			 <p>The NCAA basketball tournaments (men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s) are something that I look forward to every year, and we always have a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Silverpine<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bracket competition which is a lot of fun. Obviously, those didn&rsquo;t happen this year which was very disappointing, but understandable given the situation.</p>
<p>Not to be deterred though, we went ahead and held our own competition this year during our weekly video call with the whole company! The way it worked was that I would say two items over the call and then everyone would write their pick on a piece of paper and hold it up to the camera. For example, I would call out &ldquo;elephant and giraffe&rdquo; and everyone would have to write down either elephant or giraffe. The pick with the most votes would move on to the next round until we were able to crown a 2020 champion.</p>
<p>The first round competitors were largely paired together like &ldquo;Cake vs Pie.&rdquo; However once we proceeded to the second round, people had to choose from several non-sequitur items like &ldquo;Seattle vs Taylor Swift.&rdquo; Some of the pairings had clear winners while others were decided by a single vote, and it was a nail biter down to the end. The Final Four consisted of Dog, Blue, Pie and the ultimate Cinderella pick - Aquarium. In the championship, though, Dog easily coasted past Pie for the win and became the Silverpine 2020 Bracket Champion.</p>
<p>The whole &ldquo;competition&rdquo; was a lot of fun and a nice little stress relief, but it also was a great way for the team to get to know each other better. (We found out that one of our employees is a huge pie fan, and that another prefers C++ over dogs!) I actually think we might make this an annual event as the feedback on it has been overwhelmingly positive. Below is the completed bracket. No comments on my terrible handwriting!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>How many calls have you been on where the video glitches or freezes? Have you ever seen an attendee list that shows the same attendee multiple times? How many calls have you been on where people are &ldquo;dropped&rdquo; halfway through the meeting? How many meetings have you been a part of where at least one person spends the first 5 minutes asking &ldquo;Can you hear me?&rdquo; It seems like anyone who has used video conferencing has at least one horror story to share.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working remotely for 10+ years and I&rsquo;ve used more conference calling applications than I can count. After a decade of doing this, I would have thought that many of these problems would have been solved, but the sad truth is that there is still no perfect solution.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, three platforms have emerged as the primary platforms for video conference calls: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Zoom<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WebEx<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Hangouts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Each platform has its own set of pros and cons, so it&rsquo;s important to understand what each of them brings to the table. If none of these work for you, I&rsquo;ve also included a list of alternatives to consider.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Caveat:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One of my biggest complaints about all video conferencing software is that it is inconsistent from user to user. My analysis of these tools is based on numerous calls and years working with disparate groups of people across various geographies, but even with all of that, your experiences may differ from mine.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cons: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One of the biggest downsides to Zoom is their history of abusing customer privacy and security: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->example 1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->example 2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->example 3<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. While the company does seem to respond to each of these in pro-active, responsible ways, it does make you wonder why it keeps happening. Zoom also requires you to install software on your computer or device, so that is one thing to keep in mind.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pricing:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> The free tier for Zoom is fairly standard as you can host an unlimited number of meetings with up to 100 people. The biggest limitation is that calls are limited to 40 minutes. If you need more than that, Zoom is actually the most expensive option with their Pro plan starting at $14.99/user/month.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cons: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One major downside of Hangouts is that it often gets confused if you have more than one G-Mail/G Suite account. Many times I will try to launch a call that my work email address was invited to only to be told I can&rsquo;t access the call because it decided to use my personal account. This can be incredibly infuriating because it usually requires logging out of all your Google accounts before it will work.</p>
<p>Hangouts technically works on browsers other than Chrome, but most people (including me) report having significant technical issues trying to use it with Safari. If I have a Hangouts call, I will copy the call URL and paste it into Chrome where it works flawlessly.</p>
<p>Finally, the biggest downside of Hangouts is that it does not seem very performant with larger groups. The video will frequently glitch and freeze if there are more than 3 attendees. Of all the platforms I have used in the past few years, Hangouts is definitely the worst performing when it comes to actual streaming.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pricing:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Google Hangouts is hands down the cheapest option. As mentioned previously, anyone with a Gmail account can use their free plan, and the paid plans start at just $6/user/month.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In general, WebEx performance is solid. It requires installation of a native application so its streaming quality is generally on par with Zoom&rsquo;s quality and I&rsquo;ve never had issues connecting large groups.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cons:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My biggest complaint about WebEx is that it frequently loses audio connections for wireless computer headsets. While this isn&rsquo;t the end of the world, it seems like such an obvious, fixable problem that I can&rsquo;t believe WebEx continues to let it be an issue. I don&rsquo;t ever seem to have these issues with any of the other platforms so I don&rsquo;t understand why WebEx can&rsquo;t address it.</p>
<p>The other complaint I have about WebEx isn&rsquo;t necessarily with the WebEx platform itself, but with how certain corporate IT groups have configured their installations. For example, we have one particular client that is a large Fortune 50 company and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->every single time<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I have a WebEx call using their account, I have to reinstall the software on my Mac. WebEx is the software that we use at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Silverpine<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and we never have any of these issues, so I know this is somehow related to their installation.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pricing:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> In the past, WebEx was the most expensive of all the platforms which would have put it into the &ldquo;cons&rdquo; category, however competition from Zoom and others have forced WebEx to introduce better priced, low-end plans. They recently updated their Free tier to include up to 100 participants with no time restriction, and their Starter Plan is a fairly modest $13.50/user/month.</p>

			 <p>A friend of mine was talking with me earlier this week about his struggles and frustrations now that he is suddenly (and unexpectedly) in a remote work situation. He isn&rsquo;t sure what tools to use. He isn&rsquo;t sure how to structure his time. He isn&rsquo;t sure how and when to communicate with his co-workers, and he has found that his home-office isn&rsquo;t set up in a way that&rsquo;s conducive to the kinds of work he needs to do. In short, he is unprepared for remote work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working remotely for over 10 years now and I often forget some of my own struggles with it. There have definitely been lessons learned along the way, and the one thing that I know for certain is that working remotely requires preparation. I think that some people think that you can just plop down at your kitchen table and declare yourself an expert at working from home, but that couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. The reality is that the transition from a traditional office setting to a home office can be tricky.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Wirecutter has a great list of products that they have compiled for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->creating a full time space to work at home.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I agree with most of their suggestions, and I highly recommend making sure that a nice, comfortable chair and/or standing desk are at the top of your list. (If you&rsquo;re wanting a second opinion, Business Insider <!-- raw HTML omitted -->also has a reasonable list).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To prevent your work life taking over your home life, it&rsquo;s helpful to develop a routine for yourself. This isn&rsquo;t to say that your routine needs to be rigid because one of the most amazing aspects of remote work is the flexibility it provides. However, it is very important to establish a general flow and process to your day. This will help you set limits for how long you work during the day, and it can encourage you to stay healthy both physically and mentally. Having a routine can help ensure you&rsquo;re getting exercise and that you&rsquo;re taking breaks and that you&rsquo;re making sure to eat lunch. (Skipping lunch is actually a common problem when working from home!) All of these things will make you more productive, but without a routine, it can be very easy to neglect them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you are one of the many people who suddenly find themselves facing the prospect of working from home, please understand that while this offers many amazing advantages, it is absolutely not as simple as it sounds. To get the most out of the opportunity, make sure to take some time to think about your workplace, your tools, and your time.</p>

			 <p>For the last couple years, my 15 year old son has been slowly building a gaming computer for himself, piece by piece. For his final computer component, I agreed to purchase it for him if he could accomplish one very specific task. Namely, I wanted him to recreate an iOS app that I had written years ago as I was learning iOS development. He has a natural inclination to programming and has dabbled with many different coding challenges so he figured that it wouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult to do.</p>
<p>For the most part he was correct. He started working on it last summer and was able to quickly get a large chunk of the functionality working. He was fairly excited about it, but then I started explaining some of the other things he needed to do before submitting it:  an about screen, a splash screen, cleaning up the layout for the various phone screen sizes, etc. What happened next was predictable. His enthusiasm waned and he pretty much stopped working on it. He filled his time with other things and his almost-finished computer sat staring at him in his room.</p>
<p>On more than a few occasions he tried to negotiate a smaller task, but I kept explaining to him that the point of the exercise wasn&rsquo;t to see if he could program (I knew he could.) But rather, could he <!-- raw HTML omitted -->finish<!-- raw HTML omitted --> something hard and complex. As any seasoned developer knows, finishing software is difficult and always takes longer than you expect. It&rsquo;s also not a skill that people learn in school. It&rsquo;s something that can only come with time and experience.</p>
<p>During this period of extreme social distancing, our kids haven&rsquo;t had school and the transition was so sudden that teachers didn&rsquo;t have time to create assignments or lesson plans for students while they are out. As a result, our kids find themselves on some bizarro extended spring break where they can&rsquo;t see anyone. The boredom is real and families are trying to figure out what to do with themselves. The silver-lining for me is that I have a little more time to spend with my family and I finally convinced my son to sit down and finish his app.</p>
<p>The amazing thing is that as soon as he finished and submitted to the App Store, he found a sort of &ldquo;second wind&rdquo; where he wants to keep working on the app and add more features and functionality. To me, this is the magical reward of finishing software. When you finish something you feel such a sense of accomplishment and get a boost of energy and enthusiasm. It&rsquo;s a feeling that I love and is difficult to explain to someone that hasn&rsquo;t gone through a tough finishing exercise. I&rsquo;m very happy that I was able to share this with my son.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you&rsquo;re curious about the app he built, you can find it here:</p>

			 <p>The past few weeks have been insane with Corona Virus/Covid-19 outbreaks causing havoc around the world. In particular, there has been a sharp uptick in companies asking their employees to work from home (WFH) even though the practice is new or untested for many of them. With so many companies suddenly thrust into this new WFH reality, I have to imagine that there&rsquo;s also been a huge jump in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slack<!-- raw HTML omitted --> users. As I&rsquo;ve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->previously mentioned<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Slack has been one of our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->core tools<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Silverpine<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for quite a while and as such, we&rsquo;ve become fairly adept at using it.</p>
<p>For anyone that is new to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slack<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and wants to jump start their productivity with it, here are a few tips and tricks that I&rsquo;ve used to help me be more productive and have a little fun while at it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quickly give someone kudos or feedback by adding a reaction to their message which adds a little emoji under their message.</li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If someone has already added an emoji and you like the emoji they used, click on it and the count of that emoji will increment similar to &ldquo;likes&rdquo; on Facebook.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Quickly reply to a message with a ¯_(ツ)_/¯ shrug by replying with /shrug</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you need to focus on something, go into Do Not Disturb mode by clicking on the bell icon and disabling notifications for the amount of time you specify</p>
</li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>If you&rsquo;re part of a channel that you can&rsquo;t leave but is just too chatty, you can mute it. You will still be able to see activity, but you won&rsquo;t receive notifications and you won&rsquo;t see the little dot indicating new messages. (I&rsquo;m a member of quite a few Slack groups and those dots drive my OCD crazy!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To add some spice, try adding a few custom emoji. For example, the Silverpine Slack will insert <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->whenever someone types :blazers: into a reply.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to leave channels that aren&rsquo;t helpful to you. I promise, they&rsquo;ll get by without you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Star (aka favorite) both people and channels that are important to you so they appear at the top of your list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pin items that are important or might be important so you can easily find them. (Pinned items remain on the free plans even if they are too far back in the history to show up in a search!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try using /giphy in a reply if you want to find a fun/snarky response to someone. Don&rsquo;t overdo it though or your admin will likely disable it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use /collapse in a channel to hide the annoying GIFs that your teammates post.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add @here anywhere in your message to notify everyone whose status is Online and is a member of the channel. This won&rsquo;t send notifications to offline users or anyone that has set their status to Do Not Disturb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add @channel anywhere in your message to notify everyone who is a member of the channel. This will send notifications to the members that aren&rsquo;t online as well. Try hard not to overuse this and consider using @here instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are in a channel with many people, consider taking a topic out of the channel and into a direct channel with the person you want to chat with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take a trip over to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slack App directory<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and see if there are any third party integrations that could help or would be fun. In particular, make sure to check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the bots directory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;m particularly fond of the survey app integrations like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SurveyMonkey<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Slack is full of all kinds of tricks and tools to help people communicate better. If you have a tip or trick that I didn&rsquo;t include, definitely drop a note in the comments and I&rsquo;ll publish an updated list.</p>

			 <p>Whenever I talk to people about being a remote company, they will often ask how we replicate the &ldquo;water cooler conversations&rdquo; that happen organically in a standard office setting. (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sidenote: I&rsquo;ve only ever worked at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one company<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that had an actual water cooler.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) The conversations they are referring to are the ones where employees talk about their families and their hobbies and many of their non-work interests. They also might talk about things that are happening both inside the company and outside the company that are tangentially related to their jobs. Sprinkled into those conversations are often times some of the &ldquo;outside the box&rdquo; brainstorming and problem solving that usually aren&rsquo;t factored explicitly into employees' schedules.</p>
<p>I believe that when people ask about replicating &ldquo;water cooler conversations&rdquo;, what they are really asking about is how to build a sense of community and trust among employees who are rarely in the same physical location. How do they create an environment where people feel like they know each other well enough to share a crazy, hair-brained idea? How do they trust each other well enough to talk about a potential pitfall that nobody else has noticed yet?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t purport to have all the answers, but I can tell you that at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Silverpine<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we lean heavily on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slack<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to help build trust and community on a day-to-day basis. If you don&rsquo;t know what Slack is, it is a software communication tool that feels a little like group instant messaging, but has a few differences that increase its utility immensely for people and groups who aren&rsquo;t co-located. (I&rsquo;ve also listed out a number of our regular tools that we use for remote work <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.)</p>
<p>To help build a sense of community, there are a few specific approaches that we employ in our Slack instance:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So how exactly do we use these strategies?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When a project wraps up, we keep the project Slack channel around for a couple months and then archive it. We will generally send a last message to the @channel to make sure everyone is ok with archiving it, but usually, if nobody has posted for a few months, it&rsquo;s a good indicator that it&rsquo;s time to wrap it up. (If you have a paid plan, you can always unarchive it if needed, but in practice, I&rsquo;ve never had to do this.)</p>
<p>Second, if you have created non-work channels that aren&rsquo;t being used, that&rsquo;s ok! Just admit that people might not care about whatever the topic of that channel is, and archive it. As I mentioned before, having too many choices can lead to paralysis and erode the very trust you&rsquo;re trying to build.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Also make sure to take a few extra seconds when you are creating the channel to decide if the channel should be public or private. This can make a big difference in terms of both information overload (if users have too many channels available to them to join) as well as that sense of belonging. If you stumble on a channel that you weren&rsquo;t explicitly invited to, it&rsquo;s hard to not feel somewhat left out.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Also, be smart about using channel @mentions. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to use @here and @channel mentions, but be aware of the dangers of overuse. They are powerful in that they notify large groups of people with a few keystrokes, but if you used too often, it can lead to people ignoring channel notifications altogether.</p>
<p>Similarly, try to get in a habit of using someone&rsquo;s @handle rather than just their name to make sure they know they are being talked about. For example, don&rsquo;t type</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure about that, but we should probably ask Jon what he thinks&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>but instead write</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure about that, but we should probably ask <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@jon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> what he thinks.&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And whatever you do, don&rsquo;t underestimate how much other people on your team look at how you are using Slack, yourself. If you are frequently joking, you will find that much of your channel content will be filled with joking. If you frequently write simple, terse comments, the rest of your team will consciously or unconsciously mimic your behavior. And most importantly of all, if you don&rsquo;t communicate often, your team will reciprocate.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you&rsquo;ve been paying any attention to the news this week, you will of course know about the major snafu in the Iowa Democratic Caucus. It is now largely being blamed on what <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->appears to be a bug<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the app developed by a for-profit third party company. I&rsquo;ve been reading the news around this with quite a bit of interest both because I&rsquo;m interested in our democratic process, but also because I have a small bit of idea what the app developer is going through. I&rsquo;ve been an engineer on apps since the early days of the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Palm Pilot<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, way back in 1999. (They weren&rsquo;t even called apps back then!) As such, I&rsquo;ve been on hundreds of 1.0 product launches, many of which have been amazingly successful, but I&rsquo;ve also had my share of painful and embarrassing failures so I certainly cannot throw too many stones from within my glass house.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, the thing that really caught my attention was the reported development cost of the app. It has been <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->widely <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->reported<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> that the Iowa Democratic Party paid the app developer $63,000 for this product. In particular, I noticed more than a few news outlets reporting that it was a large sum of money. To an individual, $63,000 is certainly a lot of money but in the context of an app development project, it is a very meager, thin budget.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As app developers, we don&rsquo;t often talk about all the costs that go into a platform like this, but given the gravity of this app, I consider this to be far too small of a budget. If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered what goes into developing an app and how much it might cost, I think this is a great opportunity to break it down. If we are following any sort of sane development model, we will do the following:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now that we have the staffing established, let&rsquo;s figure out how much time these folks are going to be working on the project. First, we need to establish a rough timeline. For an app like this, I would roughly estimate that it would consist of a month of up front work defining the requirements and interface followed by 2-3 months of active development, followed by at least 1 month of quality assurance. At that point, the app is hopefully well written and tested and ready to move to a beta test period which should, at a minimum, take 2-4 weeks. In the end we should have a project timeline that is going to run at least 5-6 months.  Now we need to figure out how much time each person on this team is going to spend working on this product.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let&rsquo;s start with the project manager. In general, the project manager is going to be the source of continuity through the entire project. They are going to work heavily up front with the client (in this case the Iowa Democratic Party) and the designer defining the requirements and translating those requirements into a user interface that will meet the needs of the diverse population that will use this app. The users of this app are going to have an incredibly broad range of technical sophistication so it will be important that the UI/UX be done well. The project manager will then transition to part time during the development phase as they coordinate the many moving parts of the project. As the development phase wraps up, they will then re-engage as the product goes into the testing, deployment and beta testing phases. Given our assumptions above, they would likely spend about 1 month working with the client and the designer up front to define the product, then transition to approximately 1/4 time during the development phase and then transition to 1/2 time during the testing phase, followed by a full time engagement during beta testing. Roughly speaking, the project manager would need to be budgeted for about 3.25 months over the course of the project.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->While the project manager&rsquo;s involvement is a bit dynamic, the designer is a little easier to estimate. They will likely spend the majority of their time at the beginning of the project creating the user interface and user experience for the app, and then they will spend a little time during the quality assurance phase ensuring that their initial designs were successfully translated to the product. Generally speaking, the designer should be budgeted for about 1 month during the project.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next up is the server/database developer. This one is a little more difficult to estimate since it is unclear where the caucus data needs to go once it&rsquo;s uploaded, but at the very least we know that it needs to provide login and authentication functionality as well as data storage and reporting. In general, the server developer will need to define the interfaces that the apps talk to as well as provide development, test and production environments for the different phases of the project. As a conservative estimate, let&rsquo;s assume that the server developer works for approximately 2 months during the course of the project.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The app developers on the project will obviously need to be fully active during the primary development phase, but even more importantly, they need to be fully engaged during the testing phase and at least partially available during the beta testing phase. As a conservative estimate, we can budget them for approximately 3.5 months of the project. Since we need an iOS and an Android app, we need to budget a combined 7 months for the project.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, we need to consider the QA engineer&rsquo;s contribution. In a perfect world, the quality person is a team of people and they are at least partially engaged from day 1 of the project. However, we will employ a conservative estimate and budget only a single person for just the testing phase of the project, which is 1 month.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So with all of that out of the way, we can come up with the following time estimate:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I cannot say exactly what development plan this company followed and I cannot say how they staffed it, (although <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->some details are starting to emerge<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->). I also cannot say if the app developer had a longer play in mind when developing the app in terms of a profit model. For example, it is likely they could have charged the Iowa Democratic Party less than the actual cost of development with the intention of reusing the platform for other states and recouping more of their initial costs. (The Nevada Democratic Party apparently paid them for an app as well, so this is a likely possibility.) The one thing I can definitively say, however, is that for an app of this level of importance, $63,000 is not a very large budget. Given the vast amounts of money that campaigns raise, it seems like this would almost end up equivalent to a rounding error. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

This post comes from my old blog back in 2004. I’m reposting it here so that I don’t lose the content. The source was hand-written HTML so the formatting probably appears a bit off.</p>
<p>About seven years ago I wrote some code to do Mu-Law and A-Law compression. About six years ago, I decided to publish an article along with the source code for it. You can find it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Anyway, the other day I received an email from someone who had taken it and modified it for what he was doing. In doing so, he found a piece of misinformation that has been in my article since I originally published it. Not a big deal, and I intend to rectify the issue. However, as we chatted over email, I asked him what he was using Mu-Law/A-Law compression for. Here is a clip from our email:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>&gt; So if you don&rsquo;t mind me asking, what are you working on that has 13 bit</p>
<p>&gt; unsigned audio input?</p>
<p>Sure. I am designing a system that monitors lots of radio stations to capture and</p>
<p>detect Emergency Alert System activations - those ugly tones and occasional</p>
<p>voice messages you hear on the radio. The system has some rather incredible</p>
<p>shortcomings for a critical system in 2005. When the emergency management</p>
<p>office triggers an alert they have no way of knowing whether or not radio stations</p>
<p>actually broadcast the alert. Sometimes the system fails - too often. So our</p>
<p>system listens to the stations and sends a report back to Emergency HQ. In</p>
<p>most cases an exception report that shows which stations did not properly</p>
<p>send out the alert. So if the dam is breaking or the nuke is going critical they</p>
<p>can try again, use the phone, send a helicopter or something.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Whoa. Code that I originally wrote to compress audio in children&rsquo;s games is now being used to help monitor Emergency situations. Talk about your unintended consequences!</p>

			&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot; face=&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overview:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
			What are A-Law and Mu-Law compression?  In the simplest terms, they are 
			standard forms of audio compression for 16 bit sounds.  Like most audio 
			compression techniques, they are lossy, which means that when you expand them
			back from their compressed state, they will not be exactly the same as
			when you compressed them.  The compression is always 2:1, meaning that 
			audio compressed with either of these algorithms will always be exactly half
			of their original size.
			&lt;br&gt;
			Mu-Law and A-Law compression are both logarithmic forms of data compression,
			and are extremely similar, as you will see in a minute.  One definition of Mu-Law is 
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;          &quot;...a form of logarithmic data compression
			&lt;br&gt;          for audio data.  Due to the fact that we hear logarithmically, 
			&lt;br&gt;          sound recorded at higher levels does not require the same 
			&lt;br&gt;          resolution as low-level sound.  This allows us to disregard
			&lt;br&gt;          the least significant bits in  high-level data.  This turns  
			&lt;br&gt;          out to resemble a logarithmic transformation.  The resulting
			&lt;br&gt;          compression forces a 16-bit number to be represented as an 8-bit 
			&lt;br&gt;          number.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;
			&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20040608152810/http://www-s.ti.com/sc/psheets/spra267/spra267.pdf&quot;&gt;
			(www-s.ti.com/sc/psheets/spra267/spra267.pdf)
			&lt;/a&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;And from the comp.dsp newsgroup FAQ we also get this definition:
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;          Mu-law (also &quot;u-law&quot;) encoding is a form of logarithmic
			&lt;br&gt;          quantization or companding. It's based on the observation that
			&lt;br&gt;          many signals are statistically more likely to be near a low
			&lt;br&gt;          signal level than a high signal level. Therefore, it makes
			&lt;br&gt;          more sense to have more quantization points near a low level
			&lt;br&gt;          than a high level. In a typical mu-law system, linear samples
			&lt;br&gt;          of 14 to 16 bits are companded to 8 bits. Most telephone
			&lt;br&gt;          quality codecs (including the Sparcstation's audio codec) use
			&lt;br&gt;          mu-law encoded samples.
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;          
			&lt;br&gt;In simpler terms, this means that sound is represented as a wave, and humans
			can only hear audio in the middle of the wave.  We can remove data from the upper
			and lower frequencies of a sound, and humans will not be able to hear a significant
			difference.  Both Mu-Law and A-Law take advantage of this, and are able to
			compress 16-bit audio in an manner acceptable to human ears.
			A-Law and Mu-Law compression appear to have been developed at around the
			same time, and basically only differ by the particular logarithmic function
			used to determine the translation.  When we get to the work of
			implementing the algorithms, you will see that the differences are nominal.
			The main difference is that Mu-Law attempts to keep the top five bits of precision, 
			and uses a logarithmic function to determine the bottom three bits, while A-Law
			compression keeps the top four bits and uses the logarithmic function to figure out
			the bottom four.  Both of these algorithms are used as telecommunication standards,
			A-Law being used mainly in Europe, and Mu-Law being used in the United States.
			&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;Please understand that I am glossing over several of the details, but recognize that 
			the entire purpose of this document is to make two extremely useful algorithms much 
			more accessable to &quot;average&quot; programmers, like myself.
			&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot; face=&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mu-Law Compression:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;As you read this explanation, remember that the purpose of the algorithm is to
			compress a 16-bit source sample down to an 8-bit sample.  The crux of Mu-Law
			functionality is deciding which of the samples need to keep the most of their
			precision.  Even the &quot;most-important&quot; sample will still lose precision.  It
			simply becomes a matter of determining how much each sample loses, and minimizing
			the loss on samples deemed &quot;more important&quot;.  
			&lt;br&gt;To generate a compressed Mu-Law sample from an uncompressed sample, the following
			algorithm is applied to the 16-bit source sample.  
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Please refer to the code listing for Mu-Law compression.)&lt;/i&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;First, the algorithm first stores off the sign.  It then adds in a bias value 
			which (due to wrapping) will cause high valued samples to lose precision.
			The top five most significant bits are pulled out of the sample (which has 
			been previously biased).  Then, the bottom three bits of the compressed byte are 
			generated using a small look-up table, based on the biased value of the source sample.  
			The 8-bit compressed sample is then finally created by logically OR'ing together 
			the 5 most important bits, the 3 lower bits, and the sign when applicable.  The bits 
			are the logically NOT'ed, which I assume is for transmission reasons (although you 
			might not transmit your sample.)
			&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;br&gt;}
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot; face=&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A-Law Compression:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;As mentioned earlier, A-Law compression is extremely similar to Mu-Law compression.  As you
			will see, they differ primarily in the way that they keep precision.  The 
			following is a short synopsis of the encoding algorithm, and the code example follows the
			written explanation.
			First, the sign is stored off.  Then the code branches.  If the absolute value of the source
			sample is less than 256, the 16-bit sample is simply shifted down 4 bits and converted 
			to an 8-bit value, thus losing the top 4 bits in the process.  
			However, if it is more than 256, a logarithmic algorithm is applied to the sample to 
			determine the precision to keep.  In that case, the sample is shifted down to access the
			seven most significant bits of the sample.  Those seven bits are then used to determine the
			precision of the bottom 4 bits.  Finally, the top seven bits are shifted back up four bits
			to make room for the bottom 4 bits.  The two are then logically OR'd together to create the
			eight bit compressed sample.  The sign is then applied, and the entire compressed sample
			is logically XOR'd, again, I assume for transmission reasons.
			&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A-Law Compression Code:&lt;/b&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Courier, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;static char ALawCompressTable[128] = 
			&lt;br&gt;{

			&lt;br&gt;Now, the most obvious way to decompress a compressed Mu-Law or A-Law sample would 
			be to reverse the algorithm.  But a more efficient method exists.  Consider for a moment the 
			fact that A-Law and Mu-Law both take a 16-bit value and crunch it down to an 8-bit value.  
			The reverse of that is to take an 8-bit value and turn it into a sixteen bit value.  In the 
			graphics world, it is extremely common to represent 32 and 24 bit values with an eight bit 
			index into a palette table.  So, why not take a page from the world of graphics and use 
			palettes for the Mu-Law and A-Law compression look up?  Sounds good to me.  In fact, 
			these palettes will be smaller than their 24 and 32 bit cousins because we only need to 
			represent 16 bit values, not 24 and 32.  In a nutshell, we will create static lookup 
			tables to do the reverse conversion from A-Law and Mu-Law.  The two differing tables 
			are presented below.  To convert from your compressed sample back to the raw 16-bit 
			sample, just use your compressed sample as the index into the table, and the corresponding 
			value in the table is your decompressed 16-bit sample.  Obviously, the downside is that 
			this method requires the memory overhead for the tables, but each table is only 512 bytes.  
			In this day and age, that's downright cheap for the absolute fastest decompression!

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Back in March, I was inspired by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Manton&rsquo;s Austin coffee quest<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and decided to try my own &ldquo;30 Days of Coffee.&rdquo; Starting on April 1 and continuing for 30 straight days, I would experience a new cafe or coffee shop that I had never visited before. The rules I set for myself were fairly simple:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Along the way, I documented each visit on my microblog which <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you can find here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I also snapped a picture of each location that hopefully gave a small glimpse into the ambiance of each.</p>
<p>This entire endeavor was an experiment in a number of areas, and I can honestly say that I learned a little bit about myself along the way. As I mentioned, I was microblogging the adventure and somehow ended up having a number of people who followed along. A few have even asked for a summary/recommendation list, to which I am more than happy to oblige.</p>
<p>The following is my list of coffee shops that I would gladly return to again. The rankings are relative to me, which means that it&rsquo;s based on a blend of coffee quality, ambiance, location and overall comfort (including my ability to work remotely). This is simply a ranked list out of the 30 that I visited, not my overall list for Portland. In fact, I think only one of these would crack my Portland top 10 list.</p>
<p>So, with all of these caveats out of the way, here is my ordered list of places that I would gladly revisit:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As I mentioned, the challenge was more difficult than I expected given how often I go to coffee. In fact, I&rsquo;ve started thinking differently about 30 day challenges in general and I have a few more I might try in the next few months. If you&rsquo;d like to see the entire list of 30, I&rsquo;ve included it below. You can also find my posts on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Facebook<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with the hashtag #pdxcoffeehunt.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Recently, I setup a microblog (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://jonhays.me">http://jonhays.me</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->) to supplement my interactions on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. After several conversations with my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Manton<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I decided that I would setup a new WordPress site and use that as the content &ldquo;repository&rdquo; and use cross-posting tools to distribute out to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for doing this, but my primary motivations are:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of my high level requirements is that I wanted to be able to post to my microblog from my phone. Another of my requirements is that I wanted to be able to post entries both with and without images. Of course the third requirement that I mentioned above is that it needs to cross-post to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>Naively, I just assumed I could use the WordPress app and setup a few <!-- raw HTML omitted -->IFTTT<!-- raw HTML omitted --> triggers and be done with it. As you can guess, it&rsquo;s not quite as simple as that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s tackle cross-posting of images first: what should be posted to Instagram for a blog entry with no image? With multiple images?</p>
<p>Realizing that simply posting from WordPress wasn&rsquo;t going to work, my first instinct was to modify my workflow so that if I wanted to post an image, I would post from Instagram and use an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->IFTTT<!-- raw HTML omitted --> action to then cross-post the image to my microblog which would then cross-post to Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, using this method is like playing a game of telephone with social media and the end result looks like this on Facebook:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Several of my friends replied after seeing these asking if my computer got &ldquo;hacked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Images aren&rsquo;t the only troublesome area either. Take for instance cross-posting of text posts larger than 140 characters to Twitter. It turns out that IFTTT is actually quite terrible about handling these as well:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Simply truncating the text without a link back to the original post is the worst kind of tease and also not acceptable. What a good cross-post tool <!-- raw HTML omitted -->should<!-- raw HTML omitted --> do is truncate at word boundaries and provide a link back to the original post. IFTTT is simply not up to the task for this.</p>
<p>In fact, as it turns out, IFTTT is actually quite terrible for cross-posting to just about every platform. I am investigating other alternatives at the moment but as of right now, I am still stuck with those terrible Facebook cross posts, and I have no way to post directly on the microblog and have the ones with images get cross-posted to Instagram.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are smart people working on these problems! I&rsquo;m using a beta tool to do the cross-posting to Twitter. The beta tool actually works quite well and I&rsquo;ve been trying to convince the author to expand to include Facebook as well, but he&rsquo;s reluctant to add more features at the moment because he&rsquo;s trying to launch.</p>
<p>With so much out of control negativity and lack of author control on Twitter and Facebook, it feels like there is an opening for something like micro-blogs to augment existing platforms in a positive way. And while I don&rsquo;t think Twitter or Facebook are going anywhere, I believe micro-blogs can help fill the gap for content creators that are conscientious about their craft.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still exploring other avenues for cross-posting and I&rsquo;ll try to post updates as I find them either here or on the microblog, but it feels like this is a viable, mostly untapped market.</p>

			 <p>I cannot believe that it has been only 6 months since I took the leap of faith to try and turn <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SilverPine Software<!-- raw HTML omitted --> into something bigger than it had been!

			 <p>Before we go any further, the lawyers are making me post this part first: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The following post is from my experience as a developer and I am in no way trained as a lawyer. Do not construe any of the following as legal advice. If you are in need of legal advice, consult a lawyer.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Ok, now to the post.</p>
<p>I have been developing apps for the iOS App Store since 2008 and as a result, I have many battle scars to show for my efforts. Unfortunately, the worst of these scars tend to come from lawyers. One particular blunt instrument that lawyers like to use is something called a Cease and Desist. These are very scary messages that are usually delivered via email but can often come in snail mail.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have received at least 10 different Cease and Desists (including one from the infamous <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doodlegate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> debacle) and have learned quite a bit along the way. Some of what I have learned has been from actual lawyers, and some from the good old school of hard knocks. My intent here is to share a little of what I have learned because at the end of the day, this stuff sucks and we&rsquo;d much rather be dealing with bugs than lawyers.</p>
<p>To start with, here is an example of one that I received last year:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am legal counsel at [REDACTED] and represent the authorized of the rights infringed by the apps described.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[REDACTED] is the registered owner of both the [REDACTED] (and its French equivalent, [REDACTED]) and [REDACTED] Design trade-marks in Canada.  As such, it has the exclusive right to their use. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When the trade-mark [REDACTED] is used as a search term in the Canadian iTunes store, not only does our App appear, but the Apps of a number of other individuals/companies. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We would ask that individuals be prevented from using the [REDACTED] trade-mark as a “key word”, as this constitutes trade-mark infringement and could be the reason why other Apps are appearing when the trade-mark [REDACTED] is used a search term.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->[REDACTED] can not tolerate, these individuals/companies benefitting from the tremendous goodwill associated with these marks.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Most Cease and Desists follow a form similar to this. The entity that has protection for their intellectual property sends a sternly written message informing you that you need to fix/remove/change something. However frightening this might sound, a Cease and Desist is not the same as a lawsuit. You are not being sued. You are simply being informed that you need to make a change in accordance with someone else&rsquo;s real or perceived protection of their intellectual property. So, what should you do? Here are a few things that I have learned along the way:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Don&rsquo;t panic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Despite the fact that these messages intentionally sound scary, you don&rsquo;t need to be afraid. In the example above, phrases like &ldquo;infringement&rdquo; and &ldquo;can not tolerate&rdquo; make it sound like these folks mean business and are prepared to bring down the hammer of justice. But if you look more closely, you will see that usually these messages are form letters. Notice that nothing mentions the name of my company or even my name. In fact, there is really nothing of substance in the email. (We&rsquo;ll come back to that in a bit.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Be polite and professional in your communication, but do not apologize or acknowledge fault<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Just because you receive a C&amp;D, it is still the responsibility of the claimant to show that you are at fault. Yes, you ultimately may be required to make a change but there are several things that need to be established first. Being polite and professional will go a long way in these types of issues. Additionally, do not immediately remove your app for sale or whatever it is they are requesting that you do. Doing so at this point would be acting with incomplete information, which leads to the third point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ask for additional information<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There are a variety of reasons to do this. The first is to signal that you have received their request and are acting in good faith. This is also to flag the fact that their claim is incomplete. As I pointed out, the above C&amp;D is almost completely devoid of meaningful information. Here was my response to the C&amp;D above:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hello Ms. [REDACTED],<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Would you please send either a scanned copy of proof of your trademark or send via postal service a hardcopy that clearly shows when the trademark was issued and under what jurisdiction it applies and we will be happy to comply.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sincerely,<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jonathan Hays<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>An excellent action is to ask for actual documentation of the patent, trademark or copyright. A few times, I have asked for documentation only to find that what they sent had absolutely no application to my app or that they were claiming to own something that they did not. If they cannot provide proof then they have no claim. Additionally, if you received the C&amp;D through Apple Legal, make sure to cc them on all of your discourse with the lawyer. This helps to both keep the lawyers honest but also will help keep you in good standing with Apple. (It also provides a fairly neutral third party with a paper trail).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Once you receive the documentation, the next step is to actually read it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This can be fairly dry reading, but I assure you that it is worth it and that it is no less obtuse than technical documentation on the latest APIs. For example, many patents have multiple claims in them. A great thing to do is to ask for clarification regarding which claims they are actually citing against you. This is especially important if the C&amp;D you received was a form letter because it means that your company was collected in some large data sweep without anyone actually taking the time to look at your App. As with any bulk data collection, there can be errors. At this point, you may or may not want to consult a lawyer on your side, however it is certainly fine to make the people that sent you a C&amp;D actually do their jobs by asking for more information. Here is how I responded once I received the documentation:</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hello Ms. [REDACTED],<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thank you for your reply.  Apple has asked us to make sure to include them in all exchanges and you did not include them on this so I am re-adding them.  That being said, I have a few questions that you have not yet addressed:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->-Jonathan Hays<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>5. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Verify jurisdiction<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Make sure that you understand where in the world they have permission to enforce their claim. The App Store is a global marketplace and unless they have protection for their claim in every country that you sell, you are only compelled to comply in the corresponding markets.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Good morning Jonathan,<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m writing this sitting in the San Francisco airport waiting for my return flight after a great week at Apple&rsquo;s annual developer conference. It&rsquo;s been an amazing week and I&rsquo;m still processing a lot of what I experienced. First off, let me say that I believe that WWDC 2014 will be considered a turning point when viewed in retrospect. As a developer, I am absolutely giddy with all of the possibilities that Apple has opened up with their announcements. There is a stark contrast between last year&rsquo;s developer conference and this year&rsquo;s conference. At the end of last year, I was thinking about all of the things that I HAD to do with iOS 7. With iOS 8, I am absolutely bubbling with ideas of things that I GET to do. iOS 8 is going to be a big deal. From HealthKit to HomeKit to Extensions to CloudKit, Apple has paved the way for some amazing things to be built.</p>
<p>And then there is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Swift<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Swift has taken my excitement about the new frameworks and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cranked it to 11<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Not only has Apple provided a sorely needed modern language to the platform, they have delivered it complete with a fantastic toolset. Clearly this has been in the works for a very long time. Swift development reminds me of the early days when I was first learning to program. Back in those ancient days, you simply turned on your computer and started typing. Swift very much has the same feel to it. In fact, I actually plan to have my 9 year old son sit down with me and learn it together.</p>
<p>This is big stuff. I am still processing a lot of what I have seen and learned and will post more as I unravel it. I think this is going to be a great year to be an iOS and Mac developer!</p>

<p>With that as the backdrop, I am thrilled to publicly announce the launch of my company <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SilverPine Software<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Based in beautiful Portland, Oregon, SilverPine is primarily a consulting business focused on helping companies bring their mobile software to life.  It hasn&rsquo;t been easy getting to this point, and I would be lying if I said I wasn&rsquo;t worried about where we&rsquo;ll be after a year or two. However, we have worked very hard to bootstrap this business and feel like the time is right to take the wraps off.</p>
<p>In addition to consulting, we intend to slowly grow a portfolio of software. To that end, we are announcing today that we have purchased <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Photos+<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Second Gear Software<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. We have quite a bit of expertise with photo Apps (see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sunlit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, among others) and when Justin Williams approached me about purchasing it from him, it felt like a great fit. We have big plans for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Photos+<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and have already put into motion the first phase of those plans: native Dropbox integration! Photos+ 1.1 is live on the App Store now so go <!-- raw HTML omitted -->check it out<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. As we roll out the next phases of the Photos+ roadmap, you will be glad that you got in early!</p>
<p>New company, new software, new hopes and fears. In the end though, I&rsquo;m pretty excited about what&rsquo;s happening. Stay tuned for more news as the leap towards the net continues!</p>

			 <p>For Sunlit 1.1 we decided to expand the import capabilities to include both Flickr and Instagram photos. One of my challenges in developing the interfaces was to simplify down the various functions available from Flickr and Instagram&rsquo;s APIs and to try and provide a somewhat consistent interface across the two services for the app despite their differences. Writing this code was no mean feat for me as I had to implement OAuth not once, but twice because Flickr and Instagram use slightly different variations so I couldn&rsquo;t simply reuse the code across the two classes.</p>
<p>By the time I was done, I was relatively happy with the interface I had created, and in the spirit of openness and sharing with the community in which I develop, I have decided publish the source for querying and requesting data from both these services in my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->open source toolbox code<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Affectionately named UUFlickr and UUInstagram, the classes are relatively simple to use, and you should be able to get you up and running quickly. The only moderately tricky part is updating your app to handle the URL callback mechanisms required by the OAuth implementations. I had fun developing this code, and hopefully someone will find this useful. If you&rsquo;re interested in using it in your project but need a little help, feel free to ping me and I&rsquo;ll see if we can&rsquo;t figure it out.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

			 <p>The strange case of Flappy Bird seems to be all over the Internet right now. If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with the app, take a moment to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->educate yourself<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Reading comments from its creator, it&rsquo;s clear that the developer did nothing to promote his app, and obviously had no idea that the wave of success was coming his way. Anyone with a discerning eye that plays the game will also come away confused because quite bluntly, there&rsquo;s nothing noteworthy here. Instead, what you see is a bizarre case of mob mentality charging through the App Store, and ultimately, I feel sorry for him. However, what concerns me most about this situation is that it highlights all the things that are wrong with the App Store and the most troubling aspects being that these two things have now become the accepted norm:</p>

			 <p>Apple&rsquo;s next product is going to be a smart band. Not a smart watch; a smart band. The difference is subtle, but significant: a smart watch implies that the device&rsquo;s input is chiefly on its face and that its primary job is to display information to the wearer. As a long time smart band wearer, I can tell you that a smart band very rarely displays information and is much more important as an information collector, and this is where it gets interesting: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple&rsquo;s next product is going to convince you to put a device in direct contact with your skin<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If they succeed in convincing you the things that can be done are limited only by the complexity of its sensors: heart rate sensors, respiration sensors, temperature sensors, vasculature visualization, non-invasive glucose monitoring, and more. This also falls in line with some of Apple&rsquo;s recent hires: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Roy J.E.M Raymann<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Michael O&rsquo;Reilly M.D<!-- raw HTML omitted -->., <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nancy Dougherty, Ravi Narashiman<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->etc.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This has the potential to radically change healthcare in our world. Apple&rsquo;s new device could revolutionize how we think about detection and prevention, and if you ask any medical expert they will tell you that prevention and detection is orders of magnitude more important than treatment.</p>
<p>Manton Reece thinks that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple needs to fall in love<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with their next product category, and I think he&rsquo;s right, but I actually think that Apple <!-- raw HTML omitted -->has<!-- raw HTML omitted --> fallen in love with its next product which is exactly why it hasn&rsquo;t launched yet. One of the problems with being in love with something that you&rsquo;re developing is knowing when to ship 1.0. It needs to be right. It needs to be perfect. I have a feeling, though, that they&rsquo;re getting close, and when they do finally announce it, we&rsquo;re going to be amazed.</p>

			 <p>As we approach the impending Superbowl featuring the Pacific Northwest&rsquo;s very own Seattle Seahawks, I felt it appropriate to explain why I am not at all excited about anything other than the commercials. You see, if you grew up in the Pacific Northwest and you are a sports fan of any kind, then you are familiar with a pattern of sports teams that excel in the regular season only to fall apart when it matters. I&rsquo;m sure that somehow this has seeped into my psyche in ways that I don&rsquo;t recognize. Lest you think I exaggerate, I leave the following for your consideration:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The 10 best athletes to never win a championship in the Pacific Northwest:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>So there you have it. The Pacific Northwest has the capacity to produce fantastic sports teams and franchises, but they leave a 30 year legacy of ultimate disappointment. Am I proud of the Trailblazers and the Seahawks and the Mariners? Sure. They&rsquo;re my teams. But you&rsquo;ll have to excuse me if I don&rsquo;t hold my breath on this whole Superbowl excitement.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Manton explained on his blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we have been working on Sunlit for a long time. During that time, I can tell you that Sunlit changed and evolved from what we originally had envisioned. However, if you listen to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Core Intuition<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, you know that we&rsquo;ve been beta&rsquo;ing the app for quite a while. So, when <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jared Sinclair<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Justin Williams announced<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overshare Kit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> open source replacement for iOS UIActivityViewControllers, we had a hard decision to make. We had to decide if it was worth adding new functionality at such a late point in our development or if we could live without it.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t want to get into a UI/UX design war with anyone. I know that there are various, differing opinions on the look and feel of iOS 7 and I am but a humble developer. However, if you have ever implemented a custom UIActivity in iOS it is undeniable that the monochrome icons that you are forced to use look inexcusably ugly. In fact, they are so disappointingly ugly that Manton and I felt that we had no choice but to use Overshare Kit.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I am proud of many things that we&rsquo;ve built into Sunlit and our support for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overshare Kit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is one of them. I love the iOS development community and Jared is a great guy so being able to support a project that he owns and cares about is a good feeling. We also had the opportunity to contribute directly to the project and a number of changes that we made for Sunlit made it back into the master branch. To me, this is the heart and soul of iOS development. It&rsquo;s doing things with other people that share your value of quality.</p>
<p>If you are a developer, and you haven&rsquo;t checked out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overshare Kit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, you really should. It allows you to create beautiful sharing activity views. It comes with some of the most common ones out of the box (Facebook, Twitter, etc) and is fairly easy to extend. Jared is also very responsive with suggestions/fixes for things, and while it&rsquo;s only been around for a few months, I can&rsquo;t recommend it highly enough. Oh, and if you&rsquo;re having trouble integrating it, feel free to hit me up. I&rsquo;d love to see more apps using it.</p>

			 <p>If you don&rsquo;t like my new app <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sunlit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I will still be happy. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I hope you like Sunlit and it helps you do things with your photos and memories that you couldn&rsquo;t do before, but if you don&rsquo;t like it, I&rsquo;ll still be happy. I&rsquo;ll be happy because Sunlit is for me.</p>
<p>Sunlit is an app that I&rsquo;ve wanted for years and I&rsquo;m thrilled to finally have on my phone. One of my absolute favorite uses for Sunlit is for capturing memories from smaller events. These are events that while important, don&rsquo;t tend to have the significance of a wedding or Disneyland trip so the photos often never see the light of day. With Sunlit, however, I can now do something meaningful with these photos.</p>
<p>Earlier this year while Sunlit was in beta, I went to a birthday party for my wife&rsquo;s mother. There were about 15 people present and the celebration went on for around 2 hours. During that time, I snapped close to 60 photos of the party. Some of these photos were blurry, some of them were decent, but a few were quite good. On our drive home, I picked the best ones and created &ldquo;Nana&rsquo;s Birthday&rdquo; story. I then used Sunlit to publish &ldquo;Nana&rsquo;s Birthday&rdquo; and suddenly I had a story captured on a web page that I could share with my wife&rsquo;s family quickly via an email or SMS message.</p>
<p>This is an important thing to me. Before Sunlit, these photos were just photos. The effort to take them was almost more work than it was worth because they would rarely be seen by me, let alone anyone else. With Sunlit, photos turn into memories. They turn into something beautiful that I can share and that can be appreciated and loved by the people I care about.</p>
<p>So, if you don&rsquo;t like Sunlit, that&rsquo;s ok. Sunlit is for me, but Sunlit is also for sharing so I really do hope you like it too.</p>

			 <p>I was recently trolling through some of my previous attempts at regular blogging and I found a post that I wrote <!-- raw HTML omitted -->back in September of 2008<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It was not all that long ago and yet it seems like a lifetime ago in terms of how my life has changed. At the time, I was still working on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Corporate Ladder<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, had just finished my MBA and hadn&rsquo;t really written code for a number of years.</p>
<p>The technology world was also different.  The iPhone had been out for a little over a year and people knew it was a big deal, but the App Store had only been a thing for a couple of months and the entire universe of Apps had yet to explode. My how things have changed.</p>
<p>At the time of the post I was having serious creative withdrawals from not having written code for a long time. So I did what I always do: I started making things that I wanted to use personally, or in this case that I wanted my kids to use.  Little did I know that after having spent so long away from a compiler I was about to unleash a series of changes that would change my path in wonderful and unforeseen ways. I continued to mess around with Blackberry development for a few more weeks until I eventually downloaded Xcode one fateful day in October.  I started making little things for the Simulator and shortly after that, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Three Jacks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was born.</p>
<p>I stayed at my corporate job for a few more years, but my weekends and evenings were consumed with making and releasing Apps for the iPhone (and eventually iPad.) Eventually, I was forced to come to the realization that while I was a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->good engineering leader<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I could no longer deny the fact that my real passion was in making things and in creating code, so I finally clicked my heels three times and returned to full time development.</p>
<p>Returning to the developer life also had a beneficial side effect that I could now work from home. This opened up an incredible freedom that allowed changes in my personal life that wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible otherwise.  These were good things. I now have the flexibility to help coach my son&rsquo;s Lego Robotics team. I know that I will never have to miss my daughter&rsquo;s basketball games. I can walk the kids to school in the morning and I&rsquo;m there when they get home. If they need help with homework, I&rsquo;m there to lend a hand. If I want to take a break and build with Legos with Brendan, I can. These are moments and times that will be gone all too soon and because I started tinkering with Apps back in September 2008 I get to experience and savor them.</p>
<p>Until reading it the other night, I had completely forgotten about tinkering on my old Blackberry. The existence of this five year old blog post is an amazing gift to me. It&rsquo;s not often that you can look back at events in your life and pinpoint a single turning point where your path diverted from the course it had been on.</p>
