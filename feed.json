It was a time of experimentation and discovery. You could the sense of potential even if you couldn't quite name it yet. As I look at the explosion in AI, I can't help but feel similar feelings. This of course got me feeling a little bit nostalgic and I started to wonder how far back I could look to find my Internet presence.\n<br>\n<br>\nFortunately, thanks to the Internet Archive, I was able to pinpoint [my first Web published content](https://web.archive.org/web/19980208051236/http://cs.georgefox.edu/~jhays/) to February of 1998. Looking at it, I have so many questions for my younger self: Why did I decide to call my site Hazelware? Why did I force a television styled interface onto the navigation? How did I create the navigation graphics? Why does the default landing page feature the disgraced duo of Milli Vanilli?\n<br>\n<br>\nI wish I could remember more about how I constructed it all, but I do remember why I created it. Every morning when I turned my computer on and logged onto the Internet, I wanted to have a convenient place to go to check all my \"daily content\" including online comics, the latest Letterman Top 10 list, any new blog posts by other developers that I followed, and other frequently updated content that I cared about. So there you have it. My first Web content is just over 27 years old!\n<br>\n<br>\nEventually, I tired of having just a collection of links and I got interested in what were then known as weblogs. I decided to create my own weblog software on a Linux server in my basement running on an Apache web server and serving content up via PHP – the classic \"LAMP\" stack. I had never written PHP before so the entire exercise was both educational and fun. This was also still fairly early in terms of blog design, UX and functionality so a lot of what I did was simply copying other designs that I came across adhoc. \n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote>\n<b>This is my little home on the web. I've started to use it as a place to collect some of the things that I have learned and done in regards to programming. Be sure to check out the tutorials as well as the extensive links section.</b>\n<br><i>Submitted on Wednesday the 14th of August 2002, at 08:46</I>\n</blockquote>\n<br>Again, thanks to the Internet Archive, I was able to find my very first weblog post: [Wednesday, August 14th, 2002.](https://web.archive.org/web/20020916061534/http://www.luggle.com:80/~jon/) Honestly, I don't think the design on this looks all that bad. Definitely a little dated, but I wouldn't call it embarrassing. Since then, I've managed to recover most of my old blog content and have been able to give it a home here on Micro.blog. You can browse most of [my older posts on this page.](https://hazelware.micro.blog) There is still a gap from the original posts in 2002 until I was able to rescue the content in March of 2004, but looking through the missing posts, I'm not missing too much. \n",

Part of the problem, I think, is that much of the focus has (incorrectly) been on generative AI. People get stuck arguing about how realistic an image is, how good a particular LLM is in generating pictures of human hand, or how creepy deep fake videos are. This is largely a distraction – there's so much more going on than just generative AI! These are amazing times because with the right approach, AI can be leveraged to imagine new products that could not have been built even just a few years ago. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But while it's a radical advancement in technology, it's still just another tool in the toolbox for creating amazing products. At <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/#\">Silverpine</a>, we have embraced it internally as a productivity multiplier in our development process, and a few of our current projects have a significant AI component. However, this doesn't make us an AI company, and in fact, I would argue that a company that claims to be an \"AI company\" is very likely selling snake oil. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That being said, companies that fail to understand and embrace AI expose themselves to considerable existential risk. The power of AI is a generational leap forward in human productivity. Just like the smart phone, the Internet and the electrical grid, the arrival of AI has the potential to unlock another level in human output. And just like those other technologies, there come with it inherent dangers. However, I firmly believe that in the long run, the benefits will greatly outweigh the costs – there's no sticking the genie back into the bottle. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It feels like there are new discoveries and announcements nearly every day. Personally, I'm positively giddy thinking about the things that can be done that previously seemed impossible. And while the unknown can sometimes feel scary, we will do best if we lean into them. What can we make now? What can we do now? I'm excited to find out. Just remember that your ship will travel much further if you row with the current!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n",

Every year, we work with our insurance broker to find the best health insurance plans we can offer at a price point that is workable. Like most companies, we offer full medical, dental and vision, and as a rule, we always pay the premiums for the employee and their family because we just feel that's the right thing to do. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Across all of the insurance networks, the plans more or less look the same - as you progress through the tiers from Bronze to Silver to Gold, the deductibles improve and the maximum out of pocket shrinks. We have been doing this for just shy of 15 years now, and every year, the plans get worse and more expensive. Every. Single. Year. And yet, as we analyze the various plans, we continually find that even our upgraded \"Gold\" plan is barely more than a safety net for catastrophic or major health events. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have changed insurance networks 3 or 4 times through the years, trying to offer the best options to the team, but honestly they all seem nearly identical. The thing that's disturbing is that because we are less than 50 employees, we don't have options to simply \"buy a better plan\" as some might argue. Across all of the markets, we have only one more tier (Platinum) that we could upgrade our plan to, and even that isn't what I would consider a <em>good</em> plan; it's simply more expensive. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These ever rising prices are increasingly becoming a huge driver of base costs for us and other small businesses. <a href=\"https://silverpine.com\">Silverpine</a>'s employees have a fairly low median age, and nothing about our working environment is even remotely dangerous – we should be an ideal candidate for an insurance company. And yet nobody is competing for our business. Nobody is innovating to provide better products and coverage for us. This is a completely broken industry. Everything about it flies in the face of healthy free market dynamics.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I don't have a definitive, corrective solution to offer – I'm not an economist. But it does seem to me that health insurance is closer to a utility (like electricity or sewer service) and as I mentioned, the tenets of capitalism don't seem to apply to it. Outside of a stock price, it barely functions as an industry and quite frankly, the entire situation is bad for American businesses, especially small businesses, like ours. Something needs to change because health insurance is not only broken for the insured, it's also broken for most of the companies that cover the lion's share of the cost of that insurance. It's time for a change.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n \n",

With almost 10 years of searchable <a href=\"http://silverpine.com\">Silverpine</a> chat history, <a href=\"http://slack.com\">Slack</a> is an absolutely indispensable part of our day-to-day operation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.zoom.com\">Zoom</a> - There are lots of options for video-conferencing software - from <a href=\"http://teams.microsoft.com\">Teams</a> to <a href=\"http://meet.google.com\">Google Meet</a> to <a href=\"http://www.webex.com\">WebEx</a>. We have used the vast majority of them and repeatedly, <a href=\"https://www.zoom.com\">Zoom</a> is still slightly better than the competition. However, I will note that our usage has drastically fallen as our usage of <a href=\"http://slack.com\">Slack Huddles</a> has sky-rocketed.

It's a very viable alternative to <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com\">VS Code</a>, and while it isn't free like <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com\">VS Code</a>, it does have some advantages. <a href=\"https://panic.com\">Panic</a> makes great products.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.git-tower.com/\">Tower</a> - We don't mandate a Git client at all, but we do provide a \"default\" for the team. <a href=\"https://www.git-tower.com/\">Tower</a> is always improving and the fact that it's cross platform really seals the deal for us.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub</a> - Every now and then I am forced to use <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/product/\">Bitbucket</a>, and it makes me appreciate <a href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub</a>.

The interface is a little off-putting and difficult to learn, but it does what I need it to do.

I've been posting these for the past few years and it's always an interesting activity to see how things change over time. You can see old posts here:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><a href=\"https://jonathanhays.me/2020/01/04/tools-for-a-distributed-software-agency/\">2020</a></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><a href=\"https://jonathanhays.me/2021/07/08/tools-for-a-distributed-software-agency-2021/\">2021</a></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><a href=\"https://jonathanhays.me/2022/11/21/tools-for-a-distributed-software-agency-2022/\">2022</a></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Overall, we have continued to consolidate our tools, which is good from a financial perspective. One notable tool that fell from the list this year is Squarespace which we previously used to host the <a href=\"https://silverpine.com\">Silverpine</a> website; we rewrote our website as a native front end hosted on AWS which allowed us to drop it from our monthly costs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While tool consolidation feels good, I do worry that it can potentially lead to a lack of innovation. For the past few years, a lot of change has occurred in the design space (Sketch, Figma, InDesign, etc) and it felt like there were a lot of improvements being made amidst healthy competition. But this past year, that has slowed way down. Even amongst teleconferencing software it feels like things have mostly collapsed to a primary three options. I sincerely hope that 2024 will bring with it some overdue disruption into the tools ecosystem. I am definitely ready to try something new!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"fontSize\":\"large\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Communication</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://slack.com\">Slack</a></strong> - If we could pick only one tool from this list, it would be Slack. For any distributed team, Slack is absolutely essential. One thing that I did notice that changed this year is that our team took advantage of Slack's \"Huddle\" feature far more than in years past. We pay for Zoom as well, but it's much easier for team members to quickly jump into an adhoc call and do some screen sharing if they don't have to leave Slack. Definitely a much used feature.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://zoom.us\">Zoom</a></strong> - There are three main options for teleconferencing (Google Meets, Zoom and Microsoft Teams) and while none of them are perfect, Zoom still seems to work better across various hardware configurations than the others. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://workspace.google.com\">Google Workspace</a></strong> - Google Workspace replaced Dropbox for our team last year and for the most part it hasn't impacted us much. It's a fairly economical option for email and shared storage and while the shared storage functions aren't as robust as Dropbox, it works well enough.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"fontSize\":\"large\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Development and Design</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://figma.com\">Figma</a></strong> - Last year we moved fully to Figma (as did most of the industry) and it's been great. I'm feeling relieved that the Adobe acquisition/merger fell through because Figma is one of those pieces of software that almost feels magical, and I was worried that Adobe would kill that feeling. Everyone from designers to developers to clients (viewing prototypes) extolls how simple and accessible it is. It's just a fantastic tool.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com\">Github</a></strong> - There's not a whole lot to say about Github. After Microsoft purchase it, they've mostly left them alone to flourish. We use it for the obvious code repository features, but we also use Github Actions for our CI (continuous integration) tooling. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.git-tower.com/\">Tower</a></strong> - We moved to a team subscription for Tower a few years ago and haven't looked back. Their level of support and continued feature improvement have made it the de facto GUI for source control. Our team works on a myriad of platforms and Tower is well supported on all of them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira\">Jira</a></strong> - If you use Jira, you know why you use it, and you'll probably agree that it's \"fine\". That's really all I want to say about it. Nobody <em>loves</em> Jira, myself included.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"fontSize\":\"large\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Operations</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://quickbooks.intuit.com\">Quickbooks</a></strong> - Is there even another option for keeping your books that isn't some sort of Oracle installation? Quickbooks works well for what we need. The CPA and bookkeeper are glad we use it. I guess that means something. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.getharvest.com\">Harvest</a></strong> - We use Harvest for invoicing clients and a small amount of time-tracking. We've been pretty happy with it. The reporting tools make it easy to understand cashflow and to understand when invoices are late.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gusto.com\">Gusto</a></strong> - If you need to pay employees or contractors, Gusto is fantastic. One small change from last year is that we upgraded to Gusto Plus and it has made a huge improvement in their customer support. We have employees in multiple states that all have unique tax and reporting requirements so moving to Plus has been invaluable. It's more expensive than the base plan but definitely worth it in terms of reducing headaches. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/acrobat.html\">Adobe Acrobat Pro</a></strong> - We actually have been using Acrobat Pro for years; I simply missed including it in past years. As an agency with numerous clients and prospects, we are frequently dealing with NDAs, MSAs, SOWs and various other legal documents. Acrobat lets us easily deal with whatever form we receive and sign/counter-sign them. This is one of those tools that \"just works.\" </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

It reads like a novel, but the reader gets to help determine the flow and content. One of the most common forms of interactive fiction is \"choice-based interactive fiction.\" If you've ever read any of the classic <em><a href=\"https://www.cyoa.com\">Choose Your Own Adventure</a></em> books, then you've read interactive fiction. This is the foundation of what we have built with <a href=\"https://evergreen.ink\">Evergreen.ink.</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zday-simulator/id6462632835\">already launched</a> a series of titles that are built using the platform. While working on the content for these titles, we realized that the authoring system we were building is something special, and that it has utility outside of our internal needs. We decided to open up the platform more broadly. The user experience of <a href=\"https://evergreen.ink\">Evergreen.ink</a> is incredibly intuitive, but it belies the powerful <em>Sapling</em> scripting engine that hides just under the surface. Authors can write either narrative content, or they can dip into the more advanced features and add truly intelligent behavior to their stories. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The platform is targeted toward choice-based interactive fiction intended for reading on mobile devices. This is a recognition that the mobile reading experience is one that will reach the broadest audience, and as a result, the default playback and reading experience is tailored specifically for small-screen devices. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have begun work on a native viewer as well that we plan to launch it in Q1 2024 in the Apple App Store and Google Play. Our end goal is to help authors easily write interactive fiction stories and to eventually provide a platform for monetization. Already, content authored in <a href=\"https://evergreen.ink\">Evergreen.ink</a> can be played back in a web browser or via uploading to <a href=\"https://itch.io\">Itch.io</a> where authors can monetize their stories. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Interactive fiction can sometimes seem like a novelty, but as a media platform, it has a huge amount of untapped potential. We hope that <a href=\"https://evergreen.ink\">Evergreen.ink</a> allows authors the freedom to stretch their imaginations, and we look forward to seeing what people create. This is just the beginning of the journey for the platform; we have a lengthy product roadmap and are excited about where we are headed. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ok, that's a lot of words, but since we're talking about an interactive platform, how about an example? One of the first titles we created was a short take on <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> by Oscar Wilde. It's a quick, simple example of what <a href=\"https://evergreen.ink\">Evergreen.ink</a> can do. You can check it out here: <a href=\"https://evergreen.ink/viewer/123/kPbbCAsx00GFPzKEyU_Iww\">Mystery at Gray Manor</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We hope that Evergreen.ink is useful to creatives that are interested in discovering a new platform. We hope that the tool fades into the background as authors simply do what they do best: create. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>(If you're interested in finding out more, please don't hesitate to contact me or to <a href=\"https://discord.gg/B3kVvhpXA3\">join the Evergreen.ink Discord</a>.)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

The last couple years I've posted about the stack we use and this is our updated list for 2022.

I'm not sure how you could do remote work as a team without a tool like <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://slack.com\" target=\"_blank\">Slack</a>. It's easily the most important tool we use, and we use it constantly. Recently, some of our clients and peers have moved to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Teams</a>, but for us, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://slack.com\" target=\"_blank\">Slack</a> just works so much better and is less clunky and onerous than Teams. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong><em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://zoom.us\" target=\"_blank\">Zoom</a></em></strong></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When the pandemic started, <a href=\"https://zoom.us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Zoom</a> catapulted to the forefront of video conference calling because it was so simple and easy to use. Like many other companies, we made the switch and since then, it's been a pretty solid workhorse for us. Just like <a href=\"https://slack.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Slack</a>, however, some of our clients have moved to <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Teams</a> for teleconferencing, so we definitely use it on a regular basis. However, <a href=\"https://zoom.us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Zoom</a> continues to be easier to use and it has a better integration with <a href=\"https://workspace.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Workspace</a> which is also important to us. That being said, I can envision a future where we move to <a href=\"https://meet.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Meet</a> because of cost and integration considerations, but for the foreseeable future, <a href=\"https://zoom.us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Zoom</a> is our tool of choice for meetings.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><em><strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://workspace.google.com\" target=\"_blank\">Google Workspace</a></strong></em></li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I just alluded to, <a href=\"https://workspace.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Workspace</a> is another critical piece of our infrastructure.

We have been using <a href=\"https://www.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google</a> for email since we started and over time, they have improved their offering and earned more of our business.

Neither <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-devore/\" target=\"_blank\">Ryan</a> nor I had a plan when we set out. All we knew was that we wanted to build iOS and Android apps for other companies. We had been creating applications for small form factor devices for a long time, and we knew we could use that to help others — the \"app revolution\" was underway, and we wanted to be a part of it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the early days, we took every project that came our way. It was just Ryan and me, and we needed to find a way to pay the bills. Looking back now, it is clear that we had no idea what we were doing, and we were very fortunate to survive. But in some ways it was easier. When I would explain to people what Silverpine was, I would just say \"We build apps for other people.\" It really was as simple as that. Me. Ryan. Coding away on projects that we had probably vastly underbid. I honestly have no idea how we made it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But we did make it! And one of the more important things we did during the early years was to develop a few core principles that run through the company today: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol>\n<li>We wanted control over our schedules, and we wanted to have the kind of flexibility that neither of us felt we had in our previous jobs. We both had young children, and it was important for us to be able to be present in their lives. In a practical sense, this meant that we were committed to being a remote-only company from day one. After nearly two years of a global pandemic, most people look at that aspect of our company as a positive benefit (and it is!). But before COVID, when I had conversations with potential clients I could often sense in their replies that they doubted <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://jonathanhays.me/2020/01/06/distributed-companies-are-real/\" target=\"_blank\">we were a \"real\" company</a>. I don't know that we ever lost out on any projects because of this, but I felt that it added a level of suspicion to our conversations. Nonetheless, we held fast to our dedication to remote work.</li>\n<li>We wanted to work specifically on mobile technology. We didn't want to just be developers for hire; we wanted to use our expertise in the projects we worked on. Over the past 10 years we have had many different people approach us about building websites, and we almost always turn them down, particularly if there isn't a mobile component to it. There are thousands of development shops that do web development, and that's just not who we are. Ryan and I have been developing software for small form factor devices since the early days of the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PalmPilot\" target=\"_blank\">Palm Pilot</a>. We have a deep understanding of the implications and limitations of designing and developing for mobile devices. Silverpine was and is a mobile-first company.</li>\n<li>We didn't want to grow the company unless we absolutely had to. When I left my previous job, I managed around 200 developers across several different sites, and I hated my life. Some days, I would be on the phone from six in the morning until seven at night. With Silverpine, neither Ryan nor I wanted that type of lifestyle. We knew that one of the primary factors influencing our work/life balance would be the size of the company. We have known many different people and companies in the consulting space that have grown quickly, only to burn out and eventually fold. We wanted to avoid putting on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus\" target=\"_blank\">wax wings</a> at all costs. I know that some people equate growth with success, and those people will probably never understand the concept of constraining growth as a tenet, but I can honestly say that I haven't regretted this choice for a second. </li>\n</ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even with these principles as our foundation, we have grown, and we have changed, significantly. The funny thing about building things with your clients is that if you do great work, you end up repeatedly working with them to the point that things become more like a partnership. And the one thing you absolutely need in a partnership is trust. At about the five year mark, we realized that our business started changing — our clients had developed an immense trust in us. As a result, we started taking on more and more of the breadth of work in our projects, including the strategy, scoping, and the UX/UI work. Without realizing it, we had pivoted to become an agency rather than a \"dev shop\". </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As we continued to evolve into an agency, we began to help our clients at a much deeper, more meaningful level. While we were still building great apps, we now found ourselves consulting on strategy and designing the user interfaces that we would be building. This is the point where we were able to truly showcase and highlight our understanding of user experiences on small screen devices. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's also the point where we had to confront growth at a much more significant scale — instead of just being a company of developers, we now had to become a company of developers, project managers, designers, QA, etc. We had to evolve to be able to take on all phases of a project from conception all the way to production. This forced us to do some difficult soul-searching. At the end of the day, we had no choice but to bring on more people, and I'm incredibly glad that we did! Silverpine now has some of the most wonderful folks that I've ever had the pleasure of working with. Across all of our disciplines, we've been incredibly fortunate to grow with people that share our company values. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And this brings us to the end of our 10th year — where we find ourselves today: Silverpine is an amazing group of 20+ people working 100% remotely with some amazing clients and partners. We are an agency that is involved in the many different aspects of strategy, design, and development. We are an agency that creates interfaces that make people smile. And ultimately, we are an agency that helps our clients bring value and meaning to their products and brands in ways they never imagined. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I feel incredibly fortunate and privileged to have had the experiences and professional relationships these past 10 years. If you're reading this and you've worked with us or along side us, please know that I am deeply appreciative of the time that we have journeyed and will journey together. For me, it has always been about people and relationships. Without our people, Silverpine would be nothing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So where are we headed? I truly don't know! I have some guesses, but I have no idea if they are correct because the one thing I <em>have</em> learned is that I don't know nearly as much as I think I know. However, just as we did for the first 10 years, I'm sure that we will continue to change and evolve.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I fully admit that I was caught off-guard by my first climate related emergency, and I learned quite a bit about air quality terms like AQI. I also discovered some of the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://map.purpleair.com\" target=\"_blank\">various monitoring networks</a> with publicly available data, and sort of developed an itch to participate in some of them. One aspect in particular that surprised me was how awful the air quality inside my home became. I also realized that while the air quality networks could tell me what the outside AQI was, nobody could tell me what it was inside. So, I eventually purchased an <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.getawair.com/products/element\" target=\"_blank\">Awair Element</a> to put in my office to help me keep an eye on it. Of course, being a tinkerer, I couldn't help notice that Awair provides an open API for connecting to and monitoring their devices. And so, what would eventually become <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://airaware.dev\" target=\"_blank\">AirAware</a> was born! </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, after a couple weeks, I had what I felt was a pretty decent reusable framework for iOS to connect to and fetch data from Awair devices. But by then I had an itch. I felt like I had just scratched the surface of what could be done. So after a bit more Googling, I found a number of other devices and networks that allow connecting to their APIs, and I decided to pull them into <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://airaware.dev\" target=\"_blank\">AirAware</a> as well.

I feel good when I make something and can put it out into the universe to potentially help other people. That being said, will anyone find this useful? Will it help anyone?

Many of the tools continue to be the same, but there are a few changes. Read on for the details!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"fontSize\":\"large\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Communication Tools</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://slack.com\">Slack</a></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Without a doubt, <a href=\"https://slack.com\">Slack</a> is the single most valuable tool for us as a distributed company. One thing that has changed over the past year, however, is that almost all of our clients have now adopted <a href=\"https://slack.com\">Slack</a> as well. This has been a great improvement as we can now utilize shared channels between workspaces which greatly reduces clutter and overhead. This has allowed us to stay mostly within the Silverpine Slack workspace which makes everything simpler and cleaner in terms of organization and tracking conversations both internal, and external. If you're new to Slack, or have yet to try it out, I have a few posts <a href=\"https://jonathanhays.me/2020/03/10/slack-tricks-for-novices/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://jonathanhays.me/2020/03/02/building-community-with-slack/\">here</a> to help you get going.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://zoom.us\">Zoom</a></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Looking back to where we were last year, it's clear that teleconferencing technology and tools have rapidly improved. This is one of the few silver linings of Covid. I've never held video conferencing software in very high regard, but I can definitely say that the tools have gone from incredibly awful to \"ok\". And to that end, <a href=\"https://zoom.us\">Zoom</a> has definitely moved the quality/easy of use bar further and faster than the competitors. We will see if <a href=\"https://zoom.us\">Zoom</a> can keep the crown in the coming year as <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/free\">Teams</a> and other platforms try to leapfrog it. For now, however, Zoom is the best, easiest to use tool for video conferencing for our business.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com\">Dropbox Pro</a></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Last year, we standardized on Dropbox Pro for file sharing and quite honestly, it's been so seamless to our workflows that I sometimes forget about it. I'm still surprised that Apple or Google haven't acquired Dropbox yet, but I have no complaints. It just works.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://workspace.google.com\" target=\"_blank\">Google Workspace</a></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We use Gmail for our email, and thereby get all of Google Workspace (formerly known as G Suite). I said before that I'm not even sure where I would look to replace the email side of the tools, and that still applies. This past year, however, we have also started using more of the other Workspace tools (Sheets, Docs, etc) but we definitely haven't standardized. Most of the tools are convenient simply because they are ever-present, but if you need to create a document with a significant amount of formatting, you'll want to look elsewhere. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"fontSize\":\"large\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Development Tools</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have looked at a few alternatives to <a href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Github</a> (like <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BitBucket</a>) but at this point, GitHub is pretty much the de facto standard for source control systems. I will admit that I was a little nervous when Microsoft acquired them, but quite frankly, their service has improved to the point that we now use them for both source control and for our automated build system through GitHub Actions. Their cost model is also very helpful to us now that it's seat based rather than project based. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.git-tower.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tower</a></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The choice of a git tool can be fairly controversial, and we will never mandate a particular app/tool, but we have found that, overall, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.git-tower.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tower</a> is a very good, stable, and constantly improving product. They have versions for both Mac and Windows, and their licensing model makes it easy for us to provide seats to any of our engineers that want to use it. I wouldn't say that it's a perfect piece of software, but it's definitely better than using the command line. We're not barbarians!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://mantishub.com\" target=\"_blank\">MantisHub</a></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of all the tools on this list, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://mantishub.com\" target=\"_blank\">MantisHub</a> is the one that I'm the least confident that we will still be using a year from now. MantisHub is a fairly inexpensive, hosted, bug tracking system that's based on the open source <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.mantisbt.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Mantis</a> platform. It has replaced <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://lighthouseapp.com\" target=\"_blank\">Lighthouse</a> which we previously used. We made the decision to replace Lighthouse because it has fallen into abandonware status, and lately hasn't been able to provide the workflow that we need. I wouldn't say that I love MantisHub, but it's not as heavy as <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira\" target=\"_blank\">Jira</a> and definitely less expensive. We are continually looking to improve our bug tracking system so if you have one that you like, I'd love to hear about it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"fontSize\":\"large\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Design Tools</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.sketch.com\" target=\"_blank\">Sketch</a></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.sketch.com\" target=\"_blank\">Sketch</a> has owned the \"non-Photoshop\" tool space for years, and it remains the default/standard for our designers. Sketch is a familiar, comfortable, design tool that does what it needs to do. The licensing and cost model work amazingly well for an agency and while I wish that their administrative tools were easier to use when managing seats, it's not something we have to do often. While we were still a Sketch shop this past year, it's possible that the winds of change are blowing. We've been having internal conversations recently about switching to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.figma.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Figma</a> which has quickly emerged as the cool, new kid on the block. I've used Figma a bit and its collaboration tools blow Sketch out of the water (at least at the time of this writing.) </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://zeplin.io\" target=\"_blank\">Zeplin</a></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I believe I overlooked our use of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://zeplin.io\" target=\"_blank\">Zeplin</a> in my previous tool list. That is a fairly significant oversight on my part! We've been using Zeplin for years now and I don't see that changing any time soon. Zeplin is a very robust tool that engineers and designers can use to easily export image assets out of Sketch (or Figma) and import directly into project workspaces. Zeplin provides that \"last mile\" in the asset pipeline and supports exporting for web, iOS or Android, each of which have differing format requirements. We love Zeplin!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com\" target=\"_blank\">InVision</a></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A critical part of our development process with clients is our prototyping phase. We work extensively with them to help them understand how the UI that we are designing will translate into UX. Particularly when working on mobile platforms, the interface really needs to \"feel\" right, and <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">InVision</a> is the prototyping tool that we utilize. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"fontSize\":\"large\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Operational/Finance Tools</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://quickbooks.intuit.com\" target=\"_blank\">Quickbooks</a></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like nearly every other small business in the U.S. we use Quickbooks to manage our finances. I don't have a lot of good things to say other than the fact that our CPA prefers us to use Quickbooks. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.squarespace.com\" target=\"_blank\">Squarespace</a></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Silverpine's web content is fairly static, and in general our web traffic is very low. I think it's mostly visited by people who are curious about who we are in the hopes of potentially partnering with us on a project. To that end, we don't really need much in terms of web hosting, so we use Squarespace. One of the best things I can say about <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.squarespace.com\" target=\"_blank\">Squarespace</a> is that it is easy to get a decent looking web page up, quickly. They have a plethora of templates and basic customization is very easy. If you start wanting to get fancy, though, it gets incredibly clunky, quickly. It's also slightly expensive in comparison to some of its competitors. That being said, we've been using it for years now without too many complaints.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.getharvest.com\" target=\"_blank\">Harvest</a></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One new addition/change to our set of tools is that this past year we dropped <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.blinksale.com\" target=\"_blank\">Blinksale</a> and replaced it with <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.getharvest.com\" target=\"_blank\">Harvest</a> for invoicing clients. A lot of people use Harvest for time tracking, but it also has a good set of invoicing tools and reports. Both Blinksale and Harvest are good tools and are fairly similar in terms of cost, but Blinksale seems to cater its tools more towards freelancers and less towards agencies. Harvest seems to do a better job of catering to both groups, and it's made our invoicing processes much easier this past year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://gusto.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gusto</a></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>People like to get paid. That seems to be a nearly universal truth, and for us, Gusto is how that happens. We've been using Gusto for quite a while now and they have done a fantastic job at continuing to roll out new features and products that really complement their core offering, which is payroll. We use Gusto for both employees and contractors, and I haven't heard a single issue about it. Gusto does a really good job at tracking taxes and tax reporting for federal, state and most local requirements and many times they will pro-actively alert us about upcoming changes. On top of that, their customer service is very responsive so when we do have questions about things, they get back to us quickly with real answers. Gusto is fantastic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Check it out! <a href=\"https://silverpine.com\">https://silverpine.com</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many years ago when Ryan and I were bootstrapping <a href=\"https://silverpine.com\">Silverpine</a>, we ran very lean. I'm talking bare-bones lean. Some would say that we ran on a shoestring budget, but quite honestly, I doubt we would have justified the purchase of a shoestring at that point. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>During that period,  we were starting to develop our client base and define who we were as a company, and we didn't give much thought to our website. At that point, if I remember correctly, we hadn't acquired the silverpine.com domain, and we only had silverpinesoftware.com. The site was comprised of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130516070610/http://silverpinesoftware.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a single web page</a> that said \"SILVERPINE SOFTWARE\" and it had a mailto link at the bottom (for anyone that was so impressed by our invisibility that they might want to contact us.) Our focus was on mobile development at that point, so we figured that it didn't really matter if we had a web presence. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, our clients noticed. I clearly remember receiving a phone call from our primary contact at <em>Very-Large-Corp</em>. We had just signed a contract with them to do some work and had jumped through the hoops to get <a href=\"https://silverpine.com\">Silverpine</a> into <em>Very-Large-Corp</em>'s invoicing system. He called me because he was very concerned that if our invoices showed up on reports it might prompt people to investigate us a bit. If they wanted to know more about us, they surely would go look at our website. If they looked at our website, they would question whether we were an actual company. This could potentially raise some red flags with people within <em>Very-Large-Corp</em> and cause him (and us) trouble. I remember his words very clearly: \"<em>I need you to put up a real website as soon as possible.</em>\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, I spent that weekend creating a very bland website that was mostly populated with stock images. It wasn't pretty. It wasn't amazing. But it was a real website. We were somehow legitimate at that point.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, time marches on and as it does, websites age and look crustier and more stale with every passing day. To that end, we decided that in 2020, we would give <a href=\"https://silverpine.com\">silverpine.com</a> a facelift and in the process better showcase who we are and what we do. Conceptually, <a href=\"https://silverpine.com\">Silverpine</a> embodies something that is clean, sleek and entirely complementary. The design of the website is intended to demonstrate this visually and show how a variety of strikingly different designs all work with <a href=\"https://silverpine.com\">Silverpine</a>. The intention is that we enhance and improve existing brands and products and hopefully it's now clear, visually, how we do that. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What we have today is amazing and I love it, but it's also just the start. While we very often cannot talk publicly about many of the products we work on, we can add more content that continues to explain and expand on what we are and how we do it. The new website design provides a framework and a roadmap for adding and enhancing this. I'm extremely excited to grow the content so keep checking back from time to time, and if you haven't already, go <a href=\"https://silverpine.com\">take a look!</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Oh and if you wanted the answer to my question?

I also wasn't sure if it would \"stick\" in terms of long term, viability. However, after another year of development, it's clear that Apple has made a commitment to it.

As I mentioned earlier, apps that want to use some of the newer technologies, like Widgets, have no choice but to use SwiftUI. For an app that's written natively in Swift, this will be easy. Apps written in cross-platform environments will have to work a lot harder. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eventually, Widgets and App Clips will become expected functionality for many apps, and while most cross-platform solutions already support mixing native code with non-native code, the level of complexity of supporting these will essentially require developers to be fluent in multiple languages and multiple development environments.

				"content_text": "How many calls have you been on where the video glitches or freezes? Have you ever seen an attendee list that shows the same attendee multiple times? How many calls have you been on where people are \"dropped\" halfway through the meeting? How many meetings have you been a part of where at least one person spends the first 5 minutes asking \"Can you hear me?\" It seems like anyone who has used video conferencing has at least one horror story to share.\n\nI've been working remotely for 10+ years and I've used more conference calling applications than I can count. After a decade of doing this, I would have thought that many of these problems would have been solved, but the sad truth is that there is still no perfect solution.\n\nOver the past few years, three platforms have emerged as the primary platforms for video conference calls: <a href=\"https://zoom.us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zoom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.webex.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WebEx</a> and <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/products/meet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Hangouts</a>. Each platform has its own set of pros and cons, so it's important to understand what each of them brings to the table. If none of these work for you, I've also included a list of alternatives to consider.\n\n<strong><em>Caveat:</em> </strong><em>One of my biggest complaints about all video conferencing software is that it is inconsistent from user to user. My analysis of these tools is based on numerous calls and years working with disparate groups of people across various geographies, but even with all of that, your experiences may differ from mine.</em>\n<h2>Zoom</h2>\n<strong><em>Pros:</em></strong> Zoom is currently enjoying a bit of front-runner status in the video conferencing wars. While Zoom does require you to install software on your computer/device, the installation is fairly painless, and it's simple to get up and running. The experience also seems to be consistently solid across Macs, PCs, iOS and Android devices. I've never had any issues moving between platforms on Zoom. When larger groups are trying to connect, it is rare to have stutters and freezes and this is what really makes it shine in terms of a video conferencing product.\n\n<strong><em>Cons: </em></strong>One of the biggest downsides to Zoom is their history of abusing customer privacy and security: <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/zoom-ios-app-facebook-data-updated/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">example 1</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/07/zoom-makes-it-too-easy-for-hackers-to-access-webcams-heres-what-to-do/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">example 2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/now-that-everyones-using-zoom-here-are-some-privacy-risks-you-need-to-watch-out-for/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">example 3</a>. While the company does seem to respond to each of these in pro-active, responsible ways, it does make you wonder why it keeps happening. Zoom also requires you to install software on your computer or device, so that is one thing to keep in mind.\n\n<em><strong>Pricing:</strong></em> The free tier for Zoom is fairly standard as you can host an unlimited number of meetings with up to 100 people. The biggest limitation is that calls are limited to 40 minutes. If you need more than that, Zoom is actually the most expensive option with their Pro plan starting at $14.99/user/month.\n<h2>Google Hangouts</h2>\n<em><strong>Pros: </strong></em>Google Hangouts is the video conferencing portion of Google's G Suite product line. (Technically, the name is <em>Google Hangouts Meet</em> but that's a <strong>terrible</strong> name.)  In terms of ease of use, Hangouts can't be beat: if you use Chrome as your browser, there's literally nothing to install. Essentially, anyone with a Gmail account and an open browser can start a conference call which makes this incredibly accessible. It's largely because of this lack of barrier that it has become so popular.\n\n<em><strong>Cons: </strong></em>One major downside of Hangouts is that it often gets confused if you have more than one G-Mail/G Suite account. Many times I will try to launch a call that my work email address was invited to only to be told I can't access the call because it decided to use my personal account. This can be incredibly infuriating because it usually requires logging out of all your Google accounts before it will work.\n\nHangouts technically works on browsers other than Chrome, but most people (including me) report having significant technical issues trying to use it with Safari. If I have a Hangouts call, I will copy the call URL and paste it into Chrome where it works flawlessly.\n\nFinally, the biggest downside of Hangouts is that it does not seem very performant with larger groups. The video will frequently glitch and freeze if there are more than 3 attendees. Of all the platforms I have used in the past few years, Hangouts is definitely the worst performing when it comes to actual streaming.\n\n<em><strong>Pricing:</strong></em> Google Hangouts is hands down the cheapest option. As mentioned previously, anyone with a Gmail account can use their free plan, and the paid plans start at just $6/user/month.\n<h2>WebEx</h2>\n<em><strong>Pros:</strong></em> For many years, WebEx was the gold standard of conference calling and it made deep inroads into corporate America. Today, WebEx is approved by IT infrastructures everywhere which means it can generally be used regardless of network firewall rules. It also means that corporate customers often have the software pre-installed and configured by their IT administrators. If you need to have conference calls with corporate entities, WebEx will definitely be a familiar entity.\n\nIn general, WebEx performance is solid. It requires installation of a native application so its streaming quality is generally on par with Zoom's quality and I've never had issues connecting large groups.\n\n<em><strong>Cons:</strong></em><em> </em>My biggest complaint about WebEx is that it frequently loses audio connections for wireless computer headsets. While this isn't the end of the world, it seems like such an obvious, fixable problem that I can't believe WebEx continues to let it be an issue. I don't ever seem to have these issues with any of the other platforms so I don't understand why WebEx can't address it.\n\nThe other complaint I have about WebEx isn't necessarily with the WebEx platform itself, but with how certain corporate IT groups have configured their installations. For example, we have one particular client that is a large Fortune 50 company and <em>every single time</em> I have a WebEx call using their account, I have to reinstall the software on my Mac. WebEx is the software that we use at <a href=\"https://silverpine.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Silverpine</a>, and we never have any of these issues, so I know this is somehow related to their installation.\n\n<em><strong>Pricing:</strong></em> In the past, WebEx was the most expensive of all the platforms which would have put it into the \"cons\" category, however competition from Zoom and others have forced WebEx to introduce better priced, low-end plans. They recently updated their Free tier to include up to 100 participants with no time restriction, and their Starter Plan is a fairly modest $13.50/user/month.\n<h2>Alternatives</h2>\nIf Zoom, Hangouts or WebEx just don't work for you, there are quite a few alternatives, and a few of them are even familiar names (Skype, GoToMeeting and FaceTime.) Definitely give them a try, but as mentioned earlier, each of them is going to come with its own set of pros and cons.\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.gotomeeting.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GoToMeeting</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.skype.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Skype</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://jitsi.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jitsi</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://whereby.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WhereBy</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://nextcloud.com/talk/\">NextCloud</a></li>\n\t<li>Apple FaceTime</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\nGiven the state of video conferencing software, I am unfortunately unable to make a single recommendation. Hopefully, as more people start working remotely the increased competition will force video conferencing companies to continue to improve their platforms and someday I have just a single recommendation. That being said, of the 3 most popular platforms, I would recommend Google Hangouts based on price, I would recommend Zoom based on streaming quality, and I would recommend WebEx if you need to connect with larger corporate entities.\n\n \n\n \n",

In short, he is unprepared for remote work.\n\nI've been working remotely for over 10 years now and I often forget some of my own struggles with it. There have definitely been lessons learned along the way, and the one thing that I know for certain is that working remotely requires preparation. I think that some people think that you can just plop down at your kitchen table and declare yourself an expert at working from home, but that couldn't be further from the truth. The reality is that the transition from a traditional office setting to a home office can be tricky.\n<h2>Prepare Your Work Area</h2>\nIt might seem obvious that one of the major contributors to your success at working from home is having a good place to work, but it's amazing how often people neglect setting up a proper work area. Not only should you create a dedicated space that is your \"work zone\" but you should make sure that it is conducive and constructive to you staying there for periods of time. For example, do you have ample supplies like pens, pencils, notebooks, stickies, etc close at hand? Do you have a comfortable chair? If you like listening to music while you work, do you have good headphones? Is the temperature set to a level that won't put you to sleep but won't freeze you out? Do you have proper equipment for video chats or conference calls?  In short, is your work area prepared for the kind of work that you do?\n\nThe Wirecutter has a great list of products that they have compiled for <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/lists/how-to-create-a-full-time-work-space-at-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creating a full time space to work at home.</a> I agree with most of their suggestions, and I highly recommend making sure that a nice, comfortable chair and/or standing desk are at the top of your list. (If you're wanting a second opinion, Business Insider <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-work-from-home-tech?amp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">also has a reasonable list).</a>\n<h2>Prepare Your Tools</h2>\nSimilar to preparing your work area, it's also important to make sure you have the right tools to work remotely. I've <a href=\"http://jonathanhays.me/2020/01/04/tools-for-a-distributed-software-agency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">written in detail about what tools we use elsewhere</a>, but there are some fundamental things that everyone needs like video conferencing and chat applications. However, once you've settled on your tools, particularly your teleconferencing tool, I cannot stress enough how important it is to do dry runs with them before using them in real meetings. Make sure that your audio and your video are set up properly. Do a test meeting with a co-worker or friend. You definitely don't want to be the person who makes the group wait for 10 minutes while you try to get your connection working.\n<h2>Prepare Your Routine</h2>\nOne of the major challenges of working from home is that when you work from home, you're always at work. As anyone who has worked from home knows, it's far too easy to let your working hours drift into your non-working hours. It's incredibly tempting to let yourself take one more peek at your email or work on one last task for your project.\n\nTo prevent your work life taking over your home life, it's helpful to develop a routine for yourself. This isn't to say that your routine needs to be rigid because one of the most amazing aspects of remote work is the flexibility it provides. However, it is very important to establish a general flow and process to your day. This will help you set limits for how long you work during the day, and it can encourage you to stay healthy both physically and mentally. Having a routine can help ensure you're getting exercise and that you're taking breaks and that you're making sure to eat lunch. (Skipping lunch is actually a common problem when working from home!) All of these things will make you more productive, but without a routine, it can be very easy to neglect them.\n<h2>Preparation and Kaizen</h2>\nFinally, my biggest piece of advice for working remotely is that even when you think you are prepared, you should always be on the lookout for how you can improve. In an office setting, there are many people from HR managers to facilities managers to direct line managers who observe employees and try to come up with ways that they can be more efficient. When you work remotely, none of these people will be around to offer suggestions to you. No one will tell you that your keyboard is too close to your monitor. No one will tell you that a nice plant next to your monitor will improve your mood. No one will tell you that you should take a break for lunch. It's up to you to identify areas for improvement and to become more efficient. The Japanese term \"kaizen\" refers to continuous improvement, and it is a concept that remote workers really should embrace in relation to their work environment. As a remote worker you should always be looking for ways you can improve, whether it be in your schedule or in your tools or even something as simple as the kind of chair you are using.\n\nIf you are one of the many people who suddenly find themselves facing the prospect of working from home, please understand that while this offers many amazing advantages, it is absolutely not as simple as it sounds. To get the most out of the opportunity, make sure to take some time to think about your workplace, your tools, and your time.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/db51f002c9.jpg\"> <img src=\"uploads/2025/91f4e21228.jpg\"> <img src=\"uploads/2025/6378bd0095.jpg\"> <img src=\"uploads/2025/87dbe89d1a.jpg\"> <img src=\"uploads/2025/7202ebc892.jpg\"> \n",

Quickly give someone kudos or feedback by adding a reaction to their message which adds a little emoji under their message.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-810\" src=\"https://jonathanhays.micro.blog/uploads/2025/853a71eb8b.jpg\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-03-09 at 4.01.47 PM.png\" width=\"165\" height=\"40\">\n\nIf someone has already added an emoji and you like the emoji they used, click on it and the count of that emoji will increment similar to \"likes\" on Facebook.\n\n2. Quickly reply to a message with a ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ shrug by replying with /shrug\n\n3. When you need to focus on something, go into Do Not Disturb mode by clicking on the bell icon and disabling notifications for the amount of time you specify\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-812\" src=\"https://jonathanhays.micro.blog/uploads/2025/42f1680a82.jpg\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-03-10 at 9.52.14 AM.png\" width=\"252\" height=\"400\">\n\n4. If you're part of a channel that you can't leave but is just too chatty, you can mute it. You will still be able to see activity, but you won't receive notifications and you won't see the little dot indicating new messages. (I'm a member of quite a few Slack groups and those dots drive my OCD crazy!)\n\n5. To add some spice, try adding a few custom emoji. For example, the Silverpine Slack will insert <img class=\"\" style=\"color:var(--color-text);\" src=\"https://jonathanhays.micro.blog/uploads/2025/faaf614ac3.jpg\" alt=\":blazers:\" width=\"19\" height=\"21\"><span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\"> </span><span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\">whenever someone types :blazers: into a reply.</span>\n\n6. Don't be afraid to leave channels that aren't helpful to you. I promise, they'll get by without you.\n\n7. Star (aka favorite) both people and channels that are important to you so they appear at the top of your list.\n\n8. Pin items that are important or might be important so you can easily find them. (Pinned items remain on the free plans even if they are too far back in the history to show up in a search!)\n\n9. Try using /giphy in a reply if you want to find a fun/snarky response to someone. Don't overdo it though or your admin will likely disable it.\n\n10. Use /collapse in a channel to hide the annoying GIFs that your teammates post.\n\n11. Add @here anywhere in your message to notify everyone whose status is Online and is a member of the channel. This won't send notifications to offline users or anyone that has set their status to Do Not Disturb.\n\n12. Add @channel anywhere in your message to notify everyone who is a member of the channel. This will send notifications to the members that aren't online as well. Try hard not to overuse this and consider using @here instead.\n\n13. If you are in a channel with many people, consider taking a topic out of the channel and into a direct channel with the person you want to chat with.\n\n14. Take a trip over to the <a href=\"https://slack.com/apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Slack App directory</a> and see if there are any third party integrations that could help or would be fun. In particular, make sure to check out <a href=\"https://slack.com/apps/category/At0MQP5BEF-bots\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the bots directory</a>. I'm particularly fond of the survey app integrations like <a href=\"https://slack.com/apps/A4JEUJH4M-surveymonkey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SurveyMonkey</a>.\n\nSlack is full of all kinds of tricks and tools to help people communicate better.

(I've also listed out a number of our regular tools that we use for remote work <a href=\"http://jonathanhays.me/2020/01/04/tools-for-a-distributed-software-agency/\">here</a>.)\n\nTo help build a sense of community, there are a few specific approaches that we employ in our Slack instance:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Create channels that serve an explicit, well communicated purpose</li>\n\t<li>Have a well defined strategy for populating channels</li>\n\t<li>Archive unused, unneeded channels to limit confusion</li>\n\t<li>Model the behavior you want to see</li>\n</ol>\nBecause we are a technology company with heavy dose of design, some of the ways that we utilize Slack won't be applicable to everyone, but I believe that in general, these 4 strategies can be applied to any organization that uses Slack.\n\nSo how exactly do we use these strategies?\n<h1>Create Channels With Purpose</h1>\nOur strategy for Slack channels is heavily influenced by our staffing model. We employ a decent number of sub-contractors in addition to our employees so we have a few categories of different channels.\n<h3>General Purpose Channels</h3>\nWe have two general purpose channels that are work related: \"#general\" and \"#internal\". In the #general channel (which is a default Slack channel that every user gets added to), content that is posted is generally restricted to work-related things that apply to everyone whether they are an employee, a contractor, an engineer a designer or whatever role they might have. An example of that might be an announcement about a project launch that both employees and contractors worked on. The second general purpose channel is our \"internal\" channel which is only for employees. This is sort of the inner circle where we talk about things like health insurance policy changes or company strategy. If you want to know more, you'll have to apply and join us!\n<h3>Project Specific Channels</h3>\nThis is a very common strategy and somewhat obvious, but for every project that is active within our company, there is a corresponding Slack channel populated with all the relevant project members. This ensures that the majority of the conversations about a particular project can all be found in one place. It also makes it clear where someone needs to go if they need to talk about their work. Again, this is a common strategy, but it's definitely a good one.\n<h3>Topic Specific Work Channels</h3>\nWe also create channels created for conversations about tangential related work topics, but that aren't necessarily for a specific project. For example, since we build iOS and Android apps, we have a channel dedicated to iOS development and a channel dedicated to Android development. What is discussed in these channels isn't specific to any particular Silverpine effort, but it's a place where we can cross-pollinate ideas and have conversations about some of the building-blocks of our business. It's very common for our developers to both ask for suggestions on solving a problem but also to post interesting solutions to things they have learned.\n<h3>Non Sequitur Channels</h3>\nFinally, we have a few channels for topics that aren't related to projects and aren't really related to work at all that I refer to as \"non sequitur\" channels. For example, we have the default #random channel, but we also have a #basketball channel where a few of us who enjoy the sports-balls discuss matters of the day. I am part of other Slack communities that have a number of non-work channels, like #photography and # travel. My only caution when making hobby and non-work channels is that it's very easy to overdo it and end up with a list so large that it paralyzes would-be communicators. It should always be clear what channel someone should use if they feel like talking and having too many channels can erode that feeling of comfort.\n<h1>Archive Unused Channels</h1>\nSome administrators treat Slack as immutable and that channels, once created, should exist indefinitely. I strongly disagree with that for the same reasons why I feel it's important to have a limited number non-work channels.\n\nWhen a project wraps up, we keep the project Slack channel around for a couple months and then archive it. We will generally send a last message to the @channel to make sure everyone is ok with archiving it, but usually, if nobody has posted for a few months, it's a good indicator that it's time to wrap it up. (If you have a paid plan, you can always unarchive it if needed, but in practice, I've never had to do this.)\n\nSecond, if you have created non-work channels that aren't being used, that's ok! Just admit that people might not care about whatever the topic of that channel is, and archive it. As I mentioned before, having too many choices can lead to paralysis and erode the very trust you're trying to build.\n<h1>Be Smart Populating Channels</h1>\nIn Slack, there are a number of ways that people can become a member of a channel. But the most important time to think about adding people to a new channel is at the time of creation. When you invite someone to a channel when it is first created you are communicating to them that you feel their voice is valuable, that they belong. If you wait for people go search the channel list and join on their own, not only do they miss out on some of the earlier conversations, but they can sometimes feel like they are outsiders trying to break into a clique.\n\nAlso make sure to take a few extra seconds when you are creating the channel to decide if the channel should be public or private. This can make a big difference in terms of both information overload (if users have too many channels available to them to join) as well as that sense of belonging. If you stumble on a channel that you weren't explicitly invited to, it's hard to not feel somewhat left out.\n<h1>Model Behavior</h1>\nFinally, perhaps the most critical element in building community via Slack is to model the behavior you want to see. If you want people to engage and communicate regularly, show them how you do that. If you want people to talk 1:1 as well as in group channels, make sure you're talking to your team in the direct channels.\n\nAlso, be smart about using channel @mentions. Don't be afraid to use @here and @channel mentions, but be aware of the dangers of overuse. They are powerful in that they notify large groups of people with a few keystrokes, but if you used too often, it can lead to people ignoring channel notifications altogether.\n\nSimilarly, try to get in a habit of using someone's @handle rather than just their name to make sure they know they are being talked about. For example, don't type\n\n<em>\"I'm not sure about that, but we should probably ask Jon what he thinks\"</em>\n\nbut instead write\n\n<em>\"I'm not sure about that, but we should probably ask <strong>@jon</strong> what he thinks.\" </em>\n\nAnd whatever you do, don't underestimate how much other people on your team look at how you are using Slack, yourself. If you are frequently joking, you will find that much of your channel content will be filled with joking. If you frequently write simple, terse comments, the rest of your team will consciously or unconsciously mimic your behavior. And most importantly of all, if you don't communicate often, your team will reciprocate.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n",

				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you&rsquo;ve been paying any attention to the news this week, you will of course know about the major snafu in the Iowa Democratic Caucus. It is now largely being blamed on what <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->appears to be a bug<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the app developed by a for-profit third party company. I&rsquo;ve been reading the news around this with quite a bit of interest both because I&rsquo;m interested in our democratic process, but also because I have a small bit of idea what the app developer is going through. I&rsquo;ve been an engineer on apps since the early days of the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Palm Pilot<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, way back in 1999. (They weren&rsquo;t even called apps back then!) As such, I&rsquo;ve been on hundreds of 1.0 product launches, many of which have been amazingly successful, but I&rsquo;ve also had my share of painful and embarrassing failures so I certainly cannot throw too many stones from within my glass house.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, the thing that really caught my attention was the reported development cost of the app. It has been <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->widely <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->reported<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> that the Iowa Democratic Party paid the app developer $63,000 for this product. In particular, I noticed more than a few news outlets reporting that it was a large sum of money. To an individual, $63,000 is certainly a lot of money but in the context of an app development project, it is a very meager, thin budget.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As app developers, we don&rsquo;t often talk about all the costs that go into a platform like this, but given the gravity of this app, I consider this to be far too small of a budget. If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered what goes into developing an app and how much it might cost, I think this is a great opportunity to break it down. If we are following any sort of sane development model, we will do the following:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now that we have the staffing established, let&rsquo;s figure out how much time these folks are going to be working on the project. First, we need to establish a rough timeline. For an app like this, I would roughly estimate that it would consist of a month of up front work defining the requirements and interface followed by 2-3 months of active development, followed by at least 1 month of quality assurance. At that point, the app is hopefully well written and tested and ready to move to a beta test period which should, at a minimum, take 2-4 weeks. In the end we should have a project timeline that is going to run at least 5-6 months.  Now we need to figure out how much time each person on this team is going to spend working on this product.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let&rsquo;s start with the project manager. In general, the project manager is going to be the source of continuity through the entire project. They are going to work heavily up front with the client (in this case the Iowa Democratic Party) and the designer defining the requirements and translating those requirements into a user interface that will meet the needs of the diverse population that will use this app. The users of this app are going to have an incredibly broad range of technical sophistication so it will be important that the UI/UX be done well. The project manager will then transition to part time during the development phase as they coordinate the many moving parts of the project. As the development phase wraps up, they will then re-engage as the product goes into the testing, deployment and beta testing phases. Given our assumptions above, they would likely spend about 1 month working with the client and the designer up front to define the product, then transition to approximately 1/4 time during the development phase and then transition to 1/2 time during the testing phase, followed by a full time engagement during beta testing. Roughly speaking, the project manager would need to be budgeted for about 3.25 months over the course of the project.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->While the project manager&rsquo;s involvement is a bit dynamic, the designer is a little easier to estimate. They will likely spend the majority of their time at the beginning of the project creating the user interface and user experience for the app, and then they will spend a little time during the quality assurance phase ensuring that their initial designs were successfully translated to the product. Generally speaking, the designer should be budgeted for about 1 month during the project.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next up is the server/database developer. This one is a little more difficult to estimate since it is unclear where the caucus data needs to go once it&rsquo;s uploaded, but at the very least we know that it needs to provide login and authentication functionality as well as data storage and reporting. In general, the server developer will need to define the interfaces that the apps talk to as well as provide development, test and production environments for the different phases of the project. As a conservative estimate, let&rsquo;s assume that the server developer works for approximately 2 months during the course of the project.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The app developers on the project will obviously need to be fully active during the primary development phase, but even more importantly, they need to be fully engaged during the testing phase and at least partially available during the beta testing phase. As a conservative estimate, we can budget them for approximately 3.5 months of the project. Since we need an iOS and an Android app, we need to budget a combined 7 months for the project.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, we need to consider the QA engineer&rsquo;s contribution. In a perfect world, the quality person is a team of people and they are at least partially engaged from day 1 of the project. However, we will employ a conservative estimate and budget only a single person for just the testing phase of the project, which is 1 month.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So with all of that out of the way, we can come up with the following time estimate:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I cannot say exactly what development plan this company followed and I cannot say how they staffed it, (although <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->some details are starting to emerge<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->). I also cannot say if the app developer had a longer play in mind when developing the app in terms of a profit model. For example, it is likely they could have charged the Iowa Democratic Party less than the actual cost of development with the intention of reusing the platform for other states and recouping more of their initial costs. (The Nevada Democratic Party apparently paid them for an app as well, so this is a likely possibility.) The one thing I can definitively say, however, is that for an app of this level of importance, $63,000 is not a very large budget. Given the vast amounts of money that campaigns raise, it seems like this would almost end up equivalent to a rounding error. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",
				"content_text": "<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">If you've been paying any attention to the news this week, you will of course know about the major snafu in the Iowa Democratic Caucus. It is now largely being blamed on what </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShadowIncHQ/status/1224773797380837377?s=20\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">appears to be a bug</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> in the app developed by a for-profit third party company. I've been reading the news around this with quite a bit of interest both because I'm interested in our democratic process, but also because I have a small bit of idea what the app developer is going through. I've been an engineer on apps since the early days of the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PalmPilot\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Palm Pilot</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, way back in 1999. (They weren't even called apps back then!) As such, I've been on hundreds of 1.0 product launches, many of which have been amazingly successful, but I've also had my share of painful and embarrassing failures so I certainly cannot throw too many stones from within my glass house.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">However, the thing that really caught my attention was the reported development cost of the app. It has been </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/02/05/802904104/what-went-wrong-with-the-iowa-caucuses-results-app\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">widely </span></a><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/iowa-caucus-app-was-rushed-flawed-beginning-experts-say-n1131216\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> that the Iowa Democratic Party paid the app developer $63,000 for this product. In particular, I noticed more than a few news outlets reporting that it was a large sum of money. To an individual, $63,000 is certainly a lot of money but in the context of an app development project, it is a very meager, thin budget.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As app developers, we don't often talk about all the costs that go into a platform like this, but given the gravity of this app, I consider this to be far too small of a budget. If you've ever wondered what goes into developing an app and how much it might cost, I think this is a great opportunity to break it down. If we are following any sort of sane development model, we will do the following:</span>\n<ol>\n\t<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Gather the user and technical requirements of the platform</span></li>\n\t<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Design the user interface and user experience so that precinct captains who are going to have to use the app can do so with very little assistance</span></li>\n\t<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Develop the backend server and database that the apps will talk to</span></li>\n\t<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Develop some sort of dashboard or web interface for retrieving the data that has been uploaded by the apps</span></li>\n\t<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Develop an iOS app</span></li>\n\t<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Develop an Android app</span></li>\n\t<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Test the apps and server in a controlled quality assurance environment</span></li>\n\t<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Deploy the apps and server to a production environment</span></li>\n\t<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Have a beta test period to validate the system is operating correctly and that users can download and utilize the product</span></li>\n\t<li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Launch the product!</span></li>\n</ol>\n<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Given the above list of items needed to create the platform, we can reasonably estimate that, at a minimum, the team working on this should have consisted of an iOS app developer, an Android app developer, a server developer, a designer, a project manager and a quality assurance engineer. For an app like this, it's still a pretty bare bones team of six people.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Now that we have the staffing established, let's figure out how much time these folks are going to be working on the project. First, we need to establish a rough timeline. For an app like this, I would roughly estimate that it would consist of a month of up front work defining the requirements and interface followed by 2-3 months of active development, followed by at least 1 month of quality assurance.

If you consider a 40 hour work-week, that equates to approximately 2280 hours of effort. To calculate a total project cost you would simply multiply the number of hours times whatever your company’s hourly rate is. For this exercise, I will admit that I'm making some assumptions because I haven't seen the app in action. However, I've been doing this a long time and given the descriptions of the functionality I've heard reported in the news, I'm comfortable with my estimates. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I cannot say exactly what development plan this company followed and I cannot say how they staffed it, (although </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rabble/status/1224820389387223041?s=21\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">some details are starting to emerge</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">).

A few of them (like Phoenix) are particularly tricky! My recommendation is that when working with people in different timezones, it's best if you declare the time and timezone not only for yourself but for the person you're trying to invite. For example, let's say that you are located in Austin, Texas and I am located in Portland, Oregon, and I want us to have a meeting at 11 in the morning. (Portland is in the Pacific Time Zone and Austin is in the Central Time Zone). I would probably ask you something like this:\n\n<em>     \"Are you available for a call at 11:00 a.m. Pacific (1:00 p.m. Central)?\"</em>\n\nBy communicating it this way, I'm communicating to you that:\n<ol>\n\t<li>We are not both in the same timezone</li>\n\t<li>I would like to talk to you at 1:00 in the afternoon</li>\n\t<li>It will still be 11:00 in the morning for me</li>\n</ol>\nThis might seem like an obvious thing, but by being explicit, it helps remove any ambiguity and improves the overall quality of the communication. It also removes any assumption that the person you're communicating with understands what timezones different cities are located in. The most important skill that you can develop in a distributed organization is your ability to communicate, and one of the easiest ways to improve is to become better at communicating time and timezones when talking to people.\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph --><p>When we first set out to build <a href=\"https://silverpine.com\">Silverpine</a>, we didn't really have much of a plan. All we knew was that the fates had aligned, and that it was our time to set out on our own. From our very first day, we have managed to bootstrap the business which was ultimately very beneficial, however, bootstrapping is hard. Very hard. While we grappled with unknown cashflows and even more unknown project pipelines, we knew we had to scrimp and save and keep our costs as low as we possibly could. One major way we were able to do that was by making <a href=\"https://silverpine.com\">Silverpine</a> a \"virtual\" business in that we had no physical office space. It also didn't hurt that neither my partner Ryan nor I wanted a commute, so it definitely felt like a win/win situation.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For the first few years of our existence, our staff consisted of only Ryan and myself and an occasional subcontractor or two. Working remote became an unstated, simple to implement company policy that we grew to appreciate implicitly, and the freedom that it lent to us quickly became a de facto benefit. As we grew as a company, however, the true value began to emerge.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><p>When we finally hired our first full time employee, working remotely was still an implied benefit. At the same time, we started noticing a trend that many of the best engineers and developers that we knew were explicitly looking for new positions with significant remote work opportunities. However, when our first employee notified us that she was going to move to a rural area, it truly started to dawn on us what it meant for recruiting and retainment. Suddenly, this quirky company policy, that had just organically happened, had become an important pillar of our company culture.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><p>At that point, Ryan and I decided that we were going to commit to <a href=\"https://silverpine.com\">Silverpine</a> being a fully distributed organization. We abandoned any intention of developing a physical footprint and started viewing our evolving company through that lens. As we continued to grow and hire, I had to unlearn some of the things that had been ingrained in me from my time in the corporate world and from my MBA classes. I had to really dig in to understanding the tradeoffs of being distributed, partially because we needed to adopt tools and policies that would work well for remote employees, but also because we needed to be able to speak to our clients about how we were different from similar agencies and ultimately, why our distributed nature would benefit them.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For a long time, whenever a prospective client would ask us where we were located, I would make some sort of joke that we were following the \"IBM model\" even though it wasn't really an accurate comparison. I would then do some general hand waving about what that meant, but more often than not, I was left with the distinct feeling that we were sometimes viewed as not being a legitimate company. Because of my approach to communicating our structure, I'm certain that we lost more than a couple bids on projects because of this.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Fortunately, as time progressed, many other companies started to legitimize remote work. Companies like Automattic, Basecamp, InVision and Zapier have literally written <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/books/remote\">the book</a> on how to have a remote team, and they have shown that it can work at scale. People have started to notice how these companies operate and thrive, and maybe most importantly, many of the best engineers and developers have started to view remote opportunities as a non-negotiable job requirement. I have run into people time and again at conferences and other work-related events where they explain that having a remote position is often times more important than a salary bump. That means that there is an actual, tangible economic value to a company that embraces remote work.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For Silverpine, we have become better at articulating the legitimacy of our remote nature in a way that better portrays it as a competitive advantage. We talk about the engagement and happiness levels of our employees. We talk about the quality of communication that our team practices on a daily basis. And, we talk about lower base costs which translates to lower project costs. We also occasionally talk about<a href=\"https://jonathanhays.me/2020/01/04/tools-for-a-distributed-software-agency/\"> the tools and the processes</a> and the intentionality of it that helps craft our company culture. All of this is important in explaining our story and our organization because there are still plenty of people with an incorrect understanding of remote companies.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><p>I am convinced that the model we stumbled upon (but ultimately embraced) is a blueprint for long term success. It allows us a flexibility and nimbleness that other corporations simply can't match, and in the ever-changing world that we live in, flexibility is a survival trait. As the Japanese proverb states: \"The Bamboo that bends is stronger than the Oak that resists.\"</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph --><p>We are definitely still learning and adapting how we function and operate, but I no longer act sheepish or apologize for being a remote company. I am proud of what we are building and what Silverpine has become. (It also doesn't hurt that our <a href=\"http://www.silverpine.com/testimonials\">track record</a> is pretty great!) So, if you are thinking about working at a remote company or thinking about adopting remote-friendly policies, don't approach it as some odd-ball thing. Take some time and read about what/how other companies that are doing it, and recognize that distributed companies are real.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph /-->\n",

				"content_text": "One of the things that I am most proud of is that <a href=\"http://silverpine.com\">Silverpine</a> is a 100% distributed company. Often when people find out that we are fully remote, they will ask curiously about what tools we use to work together. This is completely understandable because the importance of having the right tool set is magnified for remote companies. We understand this innately and as such we are constantly evaluating our software stack. The following list represents the software that powers our business. (I have intentionally omitted some of the lower level development tools like Xcode and Android Studio.) The list is broken into four primary classifications: communication, development, project execution, and finance.\n<h3><strong>Communication</strong></h3>\n<h4><a href=\"https://slack.com\">Slack </a></h4>\nBefore Slack, we used a hodge lodge of messaging tools like AIM, Google Chat and even old school SMS. It was horrible. Slack is the single most important tool that we use to communicate with each other and with our clients. All of our employees and contractors use it extensively every day, and even though I think that there should be some middle ground in their pricing between the paid and the pro plans, I can't imagine trying to work remotely without it.\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.webex.com\">Webex</a></h4>\nLet me just preface this by clarifying that I think that every single conference calling platform is terrible. I have used them all. From Zoom.io to Google Hangouts to AT&amp;T Connect, they are just barely workable. Besides the all too common call drops they also all seem to suffer from ridiculous installation processes and byzantine user interfaces (Does this yellow button state mean my microphone is on mute or can they hear me?)\n\nThat being said, we have been using Webex for a very long time; not because it is good, but because it is better than the alternatives. And for our enterprise clients, it is somewhat of a known entity so we seem to spend less time per call doing the \"can you hear me\" dance. I wouldn't say that I <em>recommend</em> Webex. It's just what we use.\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/pro\">Dropbox Pro</a></h4>\nWe have been using Dropbox on personal plans for quite a while, but we recently decided to standardize on Dropbox Pro for file sharing. All of our projects have quite a bit of documentation, graphical assets and other large files that aren't well suited for source control tools. Dropbox allows us to create per project file drops that we can easily access as well as share with other people when appropriate. We almost switched to Box.com because their pro plans have unlimited storage but ultimately decided it would be less transitional headache to just upgrade our existing Dropbox plans.\n<h4><a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com\">G Suite</a></h4>\nWe have been using Google for our email and calendar services for so long that our silverpinesoftware.com domain is still functioning under the original beta operating agreement. If G Suite disappeared I honestly wouldn't even know where to start looking for a replacement. File this one under \"it just works.\"\n<h3><strong>Development</strong></h3>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com\">InVision</a></h4>\nOne of Silverpine's guiding design principles is that every user interface needs to have a beautiful \"feel\" to it, and that you simply can't judge the feel of an app until you can hold it in your hand and interact with it. Because of this philosophy,  we have refined our development process over time to rely heavily on InVision to prototype the UI and UX of our apps before we ever even start writing code. The amount of time and pain it saves both us and our clients cannot be overstated. If you design for mobile, you really should be using InVision or something like it.\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub</a></h4>\nIf you write software, you should be using a source control platform. If you need a source control platform you should be using GitHub. If you're using something else, I'm sure you have a reason for it, but it's probably not a very good reason. (All of our projects use GitHub repositories so when they changed their pricing model to be per user rather than per repository, it made our lives a lot easer.)\n<h4><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/\">Azure DevOps</a></h4>\nThis one might surprise some people, but a couple years ago we transitioned to what is now known as Microsoft Azure DevOps for our automated build system and have been using it ever since. Prior to Azure DevOps we had used a variety of tools including TestFlight (bought by Apple), Fabric (bought by Twitter, then bought by Google), and BuddyBuild (ran out of money). Due to intense consolidation in that particular sector, we were frequently having to retroactively change our toolset which was both time consuming and costly. A friend of mine who works on the Microsoft tools team encouraged us to give Azure DevOps a try, and we have been extremely happy with that decision. Azure DevOps supports both iOS and Android, is massively configurable, has 24/7 support and most importantly, is backed by one of the largest companies in the world so it won't be disappearing any time soon. If you need an automated build system and haven't taken a look at Azure, I highly recommend at least kicking its tires.\n<h3><strong>Project Execution</strong></h3>\n<h4><a href=\"https://basecamp.com\">Basecamp</a></h4>\nFor many years, we wandered in the desert of project management, largely piggybacking on whatever project management tools our clients happened to be using at the time. As such, we have used everything from Jira to Asana to Microsoft Excel to track projects and tasks. However, in the past year we have implemented Basecamp as our standard internal project tracking tool. One of the things I like best about Basecamp is that it has clearly been thoughtfully designed. Not only is it powerful, but its design somehow works to ensure that it doesn't become overly burdensome in the same way that other similarly complex tools do.\n<h4><a href=\"https://lighthouseapp.com\">Lighthouse</a></h4>\nIf there was one piece of web software that I would invest internal Silverpine resources on, it would be a lightweight bug tracking tool. There just aren't many platforms out there that can strike a balance of utility and ease of use that errs on the side of ease of use. For now, Lighthouse foots the bill for us in that regard, however, I'm not sure how much longer it will be around. There hasn't been any significant development done on it in the 6+ years that we've been using it, so I'm not sure I would necessarily recommend it. That being said, it does what we need bug tracking software to do, and it does it well, and I haven't found a replacement. If you have any personal favorites, please let me know.\n<h3><strong>Finance</strong></h3>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.blinksale.com\">Blinksale</a></h4>\nSilverpine is a services business and sending invoices to our customers is literally how we are able to make money. Blinksale is the tool we use to send those invoices and look like we are professionals in the process. While it isn't a complex tool, it expertly does what we need it to do: send and track professional looking invoices. If you send invoices to clients, you really should be using a tool like Blinksale because people can tell when you don't.\n<h4><a href=\"https://quickbooks.intuit.com\">Quickbooks</a></h4>\nNobody really loves Intuit. They have created not one, but two near monopolies with TurboTax and Quickbooks. However, if you run a business, you need to track your finances in a way that your CPA can help you with your taxes at the end of the year, and if you tell your CPA that you use anything other than Quickbooks, they will not be happy with you and they will very likely take longer to do your taxes which means you will end up with a higher bill from them. That is the reality of Quickbooks and that is why we use it.\n<h4><a href=\"https://gusto.com\">Gusto</a></h4>\nIf you have employees or sub-contractors that you need to pay, you really should be using Gusto. The folks at Gusto are wizards when it comes to dealing with payroll taxes and W-9's and a great deal more things that I simply don't have to worry about because we use their service. Not only is the Gusto platform super easy to use, but their customer service team is actually pro-active in notifying us of upcoming tax law changes that might affect us. I am continually in awe of how great Gusto is and cannot say enough good things about them.\n\n \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/21add2a5db.jpg\"> \n",

Perhaps it was a third party component that was the\nculprit.  Perhaps, it was a fellow co-worker that broke something.  Or maybe it was\nMicrosoft itself not playing fair with its documentation and/or implementations.  \nWhatever the case, it is often very useful to be able to capture a run-time exception\nthat was generated by the CPU.  Sure, you can use a catch(...) to be your fail-safe, but\nwouldn't it be great to be able to convert that exception that was generated by the hardware \ninto a C++ exception?  I created this class in order to do that very thing.  In fact,\nthis class was the basis for my super assert that I created, because I found that I could \ncause a hardware exception any time I wanted, and by using this C++ hardware exception container,\nI could access each thread's stack frame at run-time.  This would eventually enable me to \nperform a stack trace inside of an assert, but I will explain that more in a different \ntutorial.\n<br>Anyway, I hope that this is useful to someone.

As always, this code is to be used at your own\nexpense, and I guess with this particular set of code, that means a little more.\nAnyway, I hope someone finds this interesting, and if you have any questions,\nfeel free to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20041031114020/mailto:jhays@dsl-only.net\">ask</a>.\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>-BossHogg</i>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"2\">\n<br>#include \"windows.h\"\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>bool\t\t\t\tQueryCPUID();\n<br>bool\t\t\t\tQueryMMX();\n<br>bool\t\t\t\tQueryHyperThreading();\n<br>void\t\t\t\tQueryVendorString(char* string);\n<br>bool\t\t\t\tQuerySerialNumber(char* string);\n<br>void\t\t\t\tGetCPUInfoString(char* string);\n<br>unsigned long\t\tQueryCacheSize();\n<br>unsigned long\t\tQueryCPUCount();\n<br>unsigned char\t\tQueryCPUModel();\n<br>unsigned char\t\tQueryCPUFamily();\n<br>unsigned char\t\tQueryCPUStepping();\n<br>unsigned char\t\tQueryCPUType();\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>bool Is8086()\n<br>{\n<br><dd>\tint is8086=0;\n<br>\n<br><dd>\t__asm {\n<br>\t\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpushf\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpop ax\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tmov cx, ax\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tand ax, 0fffh\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpush ax\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpopf\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpushf\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpop ax\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tand ax, 0f000h\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tcmp ax, 0f000h\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tmov is8086, 0\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tjne DONE_8086_CHECK\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tmov is8086, 1\n<br>\n<br><dd>DONE_8086_CHECK:\n<br><dd>\t};\n<br>\n<br><dd>\treturn !!is8086;\n<br>}\n<br>\n<br>bool Is80286()\n<br>{\n<br><dd>\tint is80286=0;\n<br><dd>\t__asm {\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tsmsw ax\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tand ax, 1\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tor cx, 0f000h\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpush cx\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpopf\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpushf\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpop ax\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tand ax, 0f000h\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tmov is80286, 1\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tjz DONE_80286_CHECK\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tmov is80286, 0\n<br>\n<br><dd>\tDONE_80286_CHECK:\n<br><dd>\t};\n<br>\n<br><dd>\treturn !!is80286;\n<br>}\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>bool Is80386()\n<br>{\n<br><dd>\tint is80386=0;\n<br><dd>\t__asm {\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpushfd\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpop eax\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tmov ecx, eax\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\txor eax, 40000h\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpush eax\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpopfd\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpushfd\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpop eax\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\txor eax, ecx\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tmov is80386, 1\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tjz DONE_80386_CHECK\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tmov is80386, 0\n<br>\n<br><dd>\tDONE_80386_CHECK:\n<br><dd>\t};\n<br>\n<br><dd>\treturn !!is80386;\n<br>}\n<br>\n<br>bool QueryCPUID()\n<br>{\n<br><dd>\tint hasCPUID=0;\n<br>\n<br><dd>\t__asm\n<br><dd>\t{\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpushfd\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpop\t\t\teax\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tmov\t\t\tecx, eax\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tand         ecx, 0x00200000\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\txor\t\t\teax, 0x00200000\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpush\t\teax\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpopfd\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpushfd\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tpop\t\t\teax\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tand\t\t\teax, 0x00200000\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\txor\t\t\teax, ecx\t\t\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tmov\t\t\thasCPUID, eax\n<br><dd>\t};\n<br>\n<br><dd>\treturn !!hasCPUID;\n<br>}\n<br>\n<br>bool QueryMMX()\n<br>{\t\n<br><dd>\tbool canDoMMX=false;\n<br><dd>\t__asm\n<br><dd>    {\n<br><dd><dd><dd>\t\tmov     eax, 1           ;

In the simplest terms, they are \n\t\t\tstandard forms of audio compression for 16 bit sounds.  Like most audio \n\t\t\tcompression techniques, they are lossy, which means that when you expand them\n\t\t\tback from their compressed state, they will not be exactly the same as\n\t\t\twhen you compressed them.  The compression is always 2:1, meaning that \n\t\t\taudio compressed with either of these algorithms will always be exactly half\n\t\t\tof their original size.\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\tMu-Law and A-Law compression are both logarithmic forms of data compression,\n\t\t\tand are extremely similar, as you will see in a minute.  One definition of Mu-Law is \n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          &quot;...a form of logarithmic data compression\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          for audio data.  Due to the fact that we hear logarithmically, \n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          sound recorded at higher levels does not require the same \n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          resolution as low-level sound.  This allows us to disregard\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          the least significant bits in  high-level data.  This turns  \n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          out to resemble a logarithmic transformation.  The resulting\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          compression forces a 16-bit number to be represented as an 8-bit \n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          number.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20040608152810/http://www-s.ti.com/sc/psheets/spra267/spra267.pdf&quot;&gt;\n\t\t\t(www-s.ti.com/sc/psheets/spra267/spra267.pdf)\n\t\t\t&lt;/a&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;And from the comp.dsp newsgroup FAQ we also get this definition:\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          Mu-law (also &quot;u-law&quot;) encoding is a form of logarithmic\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          quantization or companding. It's based on the observation that\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          many signals are statistically more likely to be near a low\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          signal level than a high signal level. Therefore, it makes\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          more sense to have more quantization points near a low level\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          than a high level. In a typical mu-law system, linear samples\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          of 14 to 16 bits are companded to 8 bits. Most telephone\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          quality codecs (including the Sparcstation's audio codec) use\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          mu-law encoded samples.\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;          \n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;In simpler terms, this means that sound is represented as a wave, and humans\n\t\t\tcan only hear audio in the middle of the wave.  We can remove data from the upper\n\t\t\tand lower frequencies of a sound, and humans will not be able to hear a significant\n\t\t\tdifference.  Both Mu-Law and A-Law take advantage of this, and are able to\n\t\t\tcompress 16-bit audio in an manner acceptable to human ears.\n\t\t\tA-Law and Mu-Law compression appear to have been developed at around the\n\t\t\tsame time, and basically only differ by the particular logarithmic function\n\t\t\tused to determine the translation.  When we get to the work of\n\t\t\timplementing the algorithms, you will see that the differences are nominal.\n\t\t\tThe main difference is that Mu-Law attempts to keep the top five bits of precision, \n\t\t\tand uses a logarithmic function to determine the bottom three bits, while A-Law\n\t\t\tcompression keeps the top four bits and uses the logarithmic function to figure out\n\t\t\tthe bottom four.  Both of these algorithms are used as telecommunication standards,\n\t\t\tA-Law being used mainly in Europe, and Mu-Law being used in the United States.\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;Please understand that I am glossing over several of the details, but recognize that \n\t\t\tthe entire purpose of this document is to make two extremely useful algorithms much \n\t\t\tmore accessable to &quot;average&quot; programmers, like myself.\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot; face=&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mu-Law Compression:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;As you read this explanation, remember that the purpose of the algorithm is to\n\t\t\tcompress a 16-bit source sample down to an 8-bit sample.  The crux of Mu-Law\n\t\t\tfunctionality is deciding which of the samples need to keep the most of their\n\t\t\tprecision.  Even the &quot;most-important&quot; sample will still lose precision.  It\n\t\t\tsimply becomes a matter of determining how much each sample loses, and minimizing\n\t\t\tthe loss on samples deemed &quot;more important&quot;.  \n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;To generate a compressed Mu-Law sample from an uncompressed sample, the following\n\t\t\talgorithm is applied to the 16-bit source sample.  \n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Please refer to the code listing for Mu-Law compression.)&lt;/i&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;First, the algorithm first stores off the sign.  It then adds in a bias value \n\t\t\twhich (due to wrapping) will cause high valued samples to lose precision.\n\t\t\tThe top five most significant bits are pulled out of the sample (which has \n\t\t\tbeen previously biased).  Then, the bottom three bits of the compressed byte are \n\t\t\tgenerated using a small look-up table, based on the biased value of the source sample.  \n\t\t\tThe 8-bit compressed sample is then finally created by logically OR'ing together \n\t\t\tthe 5 most important bits, the 3 lower bits, and the sign when applicable.  The bits \n\t\t\tare the logically NOT'ed, which I assume is for transmission reasons (although you \n\t\t\tmight not transmit your sample.)\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;MuLaw Compresion Code:&lt;/b&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Courier, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;const int cBias = 0x84;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;const int cClip = 32635;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;static char MuLawCompressTable[256] = \n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;{\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     0,0,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;};\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;unsigned char LinearToMuLawSample(short sample)\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;{\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     int sign = (sample &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 8) &amp;amp; 0x80;\t\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     if (sign)\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          sample = (short)-sample;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     if (sample &amp;gt; cClip)\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          sample = cClip;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     sample = (short)(sample + cBias);\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     int exponent = (int)MuLawCompressTable[(sample&amp;gt;&amp;gt;7) &amp;amp; 0xFF];\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     int mantissa = (sample &amp;gt;&amp;gt; (exponent+3)) &amp;amp; 0x0F;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     int compressedByte = ~ (sign | (exponent &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 4) | mantissa);\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\t\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     return (unsigned char)compressedByte;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;}\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot; face=&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A-Law Compression:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;As mentioned earlier, A-Law compression is extremely similar to Mu-Law compression.  As you\n\t\t\twill see, they differ primarily in the way that they keep precision.  The \n\t\t\tfollowing is a short synopsis of the encoding algorithm, and the code example follows the\n\t\t\twritten explanation.\n\t\t\tFirst, the sign is stored off.  Then the code branches.  If the absolute value of the source\n\t\t\tsample is less than 256, the 16-bit sample is simply shifted down 4 bits and converted \n\t\t\tto an 8-bit value, thus losing the top 4 bits in the process.  \n\t\t\tHowever, if it is more than 256, a logarithmic algorithm is applied to the sample to \n\t\t\tdetermine the precision to keep.  In that case, the sample is shifted down to access the\n\t\t\tseven most significant bits of the sample.  Those seven bits are then used to determine the\n\t\t\tprecision of the bottom 4 bits.  Finally, the top seven bits are shifted back up four bits\n\t\t\tto make room for the bottom 4 bits.  The two are then logically OR'd together to create the\n\t\t\teight bit compressed sample.  The sign is then applied, and the entire compressed sample\n\t\t\tis logically XOR'd, again, I assume for transmission reasons.\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A-Law Compression Code:&lt;/b&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot; face=&quot;Courier, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;static char ALawCompressTable[128] = \n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;{\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;};\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;unsigned char LinearToALawSample(short sample)\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;{\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     int sign;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     int exponent;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     int mantissa;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     unsigned char compressedByte;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     sign = ((~sample) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 8) &amp;amp; 0x80;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     if (!sign) \n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          sample = (short)-sample;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     if (sample &amp;gt; cClip)\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          sample = cClip;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     if (sample &amp;gt;= 256)\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     {\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          exponent = (int)ALawCompressTable[(sample &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 8) &amp;amp; 0x7F];\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          mantissa = (sample &amp;gt;&amp;gt; (exponent + 3) ) &amp;amp; 0x0F;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          compressedByte = ((exponent &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 4) | mantissa);\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     }\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     else \n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     {\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;          compressedByte = (unsigned char)(sample &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4);\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     }\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     compressedByte ^= (sign ^ 0x55);\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;     return compressedByte;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;}\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot; face=&quot;Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decompression:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;br&gt;Now, the most obvious way to decompress a compressed Mu-Law or A-Law sample would \n\t\t\tbe to reverse the algorithm.  But a more efficient method exists.  Consider for a moment the \n\t\t\tfact that A-Law and Mu-Law both take a 16-bit value and crunch it down to an 8-bit value.  \n\t\t\tThe reverse of that is to take an 8-bit value and turn it into a sixteen bit value.  In the \n\t\t\tgraphics world, it is extremely common to represent 32 and 24 bit values with an eight bit \n\t\t\tindex into a palette table.  So, why not take a page from the world of graphics and use \n\t\t\tpalettes for the Mu-Law and A-Law compression look up?  Sounds good to me.  In fact, \n\t\t\tthese palettes will be smaller than their 24 and 32 bit cousins because we only need to \n\t\t\trepresent 16 bit values, not 24 and 32.  In a nutshell, we will create static lookup \n\t\t\ttables to do the reverse conversion from A-Law and Mu-Law.  The two differing tables \n\t\t\tare presented below.  To convert from your compressed sample back to the raw 16-bit \n\t\t\tsample, just use your compressed sample as the index into the table, and the corresponding \n\t\t\tvalue in the table is your decompressed 16-bit sample.

In the simplest terms, they are \n\t\t\t\tstandard forms of audio compression for 16 bit sounds.  Like most audio \n\t\t\t\tcompression techniques, they are lossy, which means that when you expand them\n\t\t\t\tback from their compressed state, they will not be exactly the same as\n\t\t\t\twhen you compressed them.  The compression is always 2:1, meaning that \n\t\t\t\taudio compressed with either of these algorithms will always be exactly half\n\t\t\t\tof their original size.\n\t\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\tMu-Law and A-Law compression are both logarithmic forms of data compression,\n\t\t\t\tand are extremely similar, as you will see in a minute.  One definition of Mu-Law is \n\t\t\t\t<br><i>\n\t\t\t\t<br>          \"...a form of logarithmic data compression\n\t\t\t\t<br>          for audio data.  Due to the fact that we hear logarithmically, \n\t\t\t\t<br>          sound recorded at higher levels does not require the same \n\t\t\t\t<br>          resolution as low-level sound.  This allows us to disregard\n\t\t\t\t<br>          the least significant bits in  high-level data.  This turns  \n\t\t\t\t<br>          out to resemble a logarithmic transformation.  The resulting\n\t\t\t\t<br>          compression forces a 16-bit number to be represented as an 8-bit \n\t\t\t\t<br>          number.\" </i>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040608152810/http://www-s.ti.com/sc/psheets/spra267/spra267.pdf\">\n\t\t\t\t(www-s.ti.com/sc/psheets/spra267/spra267.pdf)\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\t<br>And from the comp.dsp newsgroup FAQ we also get this definition:\n\t\t\t\t<br><i>\n\t\t\t\t<br>          Mu-law (also \"u-law\") encoding is a form of logarithmic\n\t\t\t\t<br>          quantization or companding. It's based on the observation that\n\t\t\t\t<br>          many signals are statistically more likely to be near a low\n\t\t\t\t<br>          signal level than a high signal level. Therefore, it makes\n\t\t\t\t<br>          more sense to have more quantization points near a low level\n\t\t\t\t<br>          than a high level. In a typical mu-law system, linear samples\n\t\t\t\t<br>          of 14 to 16 bits are companded to 8 bits. Most telephone\n\t\t\t\t<br>          quality codecs (including the Sparcstation's audio codec) use\n\t\t\t\t<br>          mu-law encoded samples.\n\t\t\t\t<br></i>          \n\t\t\t\t<br>In simpler terms, this means that sound is represented as a wave, and humans\n\t\t\t\tcan only hear audio in the middle of the wave.  We can remove data from the upper\n\t\t\t\tand lower frequencies of a sound, and humans will not be able to hear a significant\n\t\t\t\tdifference.  Both Mu-Law and A-Law take advantage of this, and are able to\n\t\t\t\tcompress 16-bit audio in an manner acceptable to human ears.\n\t\t\t\tA-Law and Mu-Law compression appear to have been developed at around the\n\t\t\t\tsame time, and basically only differ by the particular logarithmic function\n\t\t\t\tused to determine the translation.  When we get to the work of\n\t\t\t\timplementing the algorithms, you will see that the differences are nominal.\n\t\t\t\tThe main difference is that Mu-Law attempts to keep the top five bits of precision, \n\t\t\t\tand uses a logarithmic function to determine the bottom three bits, while A-Law\n\t\t\t\tcompression keeps the top four bits and uses the logarithmic function to figure out\n\t\t\t\tthe bottom four.  Both of these algorithms are used as telecommunication standards,\n\t\t\t\tA-Law being used mainly in Europe, and Mu-Law being used in the United States.\n\t\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\t<br><b><i>DISCLAIMER:</i></b>\n\t\t\t\t<br>Please understand that I am glossing over several of the details, but recognize that \n\t\t\t\tthe entire purpose of this document is to make two extremely useful algorithms much \n\t\t\t\tmore accessable to \"average\" programmers, like myself.\n\t\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\t<br><font size=\"3\" face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"><b>Mu-Law Compression:</b></font>\n\t\t\t\t<br>As you read this explanation, remember that the purpose of the algorithm is to\n\t\t\t\tcompress a 16-bit source sample down to an 8-bit sample.  The crux of Mu-Law\n\t\t\t\tfunctionality is deciding which of the samples need to keep the most of their\n\t\t\t\tprecision.  Even the \"most-important\" sample will still lose precision.  It\n\t\t\t\tsimply becomes a matter of determining how much each sample loses, and minimizing\n\t\t\t\tthe loss on samples deemed \"more important\".  \n\t\t\t\t<br>To generate a compressed Mu-Law sample from an uncompressed sample, the following\n\t\t\t\talgorithm is applied to the 16-bit source sample.  \n\t\t\t\t<br><i>(Please refer to the code listing for Mu-Law compression.)</i>\n\t\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\t<br>First, the algorithm first stores off the sign.  It then adds in a bias value \n\t\t\t\twhich (due to wrapping) will cause high valued samples to lose precision.\n\t\t\t\tThe top five most significant bits are pulled out of the sample (which has \n\t\t\t\tbeen previously biased).  Then, the bottom three bits of the compressed byte are \n\t\t\t\tgenerated using a small look-up table, based on the biased value of the source sample.  \n\t\t\t\tThe 8-bit compressed sample is then finally created by logically OR'ing together \n\t\t\t\tthe 5 most important bits, the 3 lower bits, and the sign when applicable.

As you\n\t\t\t\twill see, they differ primarily in the way that they keep precision.  The \n\t\t\t\tfollowing is a short synopsis of the encoding algorithm, and the code example follows the\n\t\t\t\twritten explanation.\n\t\t\t\tFirst, the sign is stored off.  Then the code branches.  If the absolute value of the source\n\t\t\t\tsample is less than 256, the 16-bit sample is simply shifted down 4 bits and converted \n\t\t\t\tto an 8-bit value, thus losing the top 4 bits in the process.  \n\t\t\t\tHowever, if it is more than 256, a logarithmic algorithm is applied to the sample to \n\t\t\t\tdetermine the precision to keep.  In that case, the sample is shifted down to access the\n\t\t\t\tseven most significant bits of the sample.  Those seven bits are then used to determine the\n\t\t\t\tprecision of the bottom 4 bits.  Finally, the top seven bits are shifted back up four bits\n\t\t\t\tto make room for the bottom 4 bits.  The two are then logically OR'd together to create the\n\t\t\t\teight bit compressed sample.  The sign is then applied, and the entire compressed sample\n\t\t\t\tis logically XOR'd, again, I assume for transmission reasons.\n\t\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\t<br><b>A-Law Compression Code:</b>\n\t\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\t<font size=\"1\" face=\"Courier, Helvetica, sans-serif\">\n\t\t\t\t<br>static char ALawCompressTable[128] = \n\t\t\t\t<br>{\n\t\t\t\t<br>     1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,\n\t\t\t\t<br>     4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,\n\t\t\t\t<br>     5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,\n\t\t\t\t<br>     5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,\n\t\t\t\t<br>     6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,\n\t\t\t\t<br>     6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,\n\t\t\t\t<br>     6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,\n\t\t\t\t<br>     6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,\n\t\t\t\t<br>     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t\t<br>     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t\t<br>     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t\t<br>     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t\t<br>     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t\t<br>     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t\t<br>     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,\n\t\t\t\t<br>     7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n\t\t\t\t<br>};\n\t\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\t<br>unsigned char LinearToALawSample(short sample)\n\t\t\t\t<br>{\n\t\t\t\t<br>     int sign;\n\t\t\t\t<br>     int exponent;\n\t\t\t\t<br>     int mantissa;\n\t\t\t\t<br>     unsigned char compressedByte;\n\t\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\t<br>     sign = ((~sample) &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0x80;\n\t\t\t\t<br>     if (!sign) \n\t\t\t\t<br>          sample = (short)-sample;\n\t\t\t\t<br>     if (sample &gt; cClip)\n\t\t\t\t<br>          sample = cClip;\n\t\t\t\t<br>     if (sample &gt;= 256)\n\t\t\t\t<br>     {\n\t\t\t\t<br>          exponent = (int)ALawCompressTable[(sample &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0x7F];\n\t\t\t\t<br>          mantissa = (sample &gt;&gt; (exponent + 3) ) &amp; 0x0F;\n\t\t\t\t<br>          compressedByte = ((exponent &lt;&lt; 4) | mantissa);\n\t\t\t\t<br>     }\n\t\t\t\t<br>     else \n\t\t\t\t<br>     {\n\t\t\t\t<br>          compressedByte = (unsigned char)(sample &gt;&gt; 4);\n\t\t\t\t<br>     }\n\t\t\t\t<br>     compressedByte ^= (sign ^ 0x55);\n\t\t\t\t<br>     return compressedByte;\n\t\t\t\t<br>}\n\t\t\t\t<br></font>\n\t\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\t<br><font size=\"3\" face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"><b>Decompression:</b></font>\n\t\t\t\t<br>Now, the most obvious way to decompress a compressed Mu-Law or A-Law sample would \n\t\t\t\tbe to reverse the algorithm.  But a more efficient method exists.  Consider for a moment the \n\t\t\t\tfact that A-Law and Mu-Law both take a 16-bit value and crunch it down to an 8-bit value.  \n\t\t\t\tThe reverse of that is to take an 8-bit value and turn it into a sixteen bit value.  In the \n\t\t\t\tgraphics world, it is extremely common to represent 32 and 24 bit values with an eight bit \n\t\t\t\tindex into a palette table.  So, why not take a page from the world of graphics and use \n\t\t\t\tpalettes for the Mu-Law and A-Law compression look up?  Sounds good to me.  In fact, \n\t\t\t\tthese palettes will be smaller than their 24 and 32 bit cousins because we only need to \n\t\t\t\trepresent 16 bit values, not 24 and 32.  In a nutshell, we will create static lookup \n\t\t\t\ttables to do the reverse conversion from A-Law and Mu-Law.  The two differing tables \n\t\t\t\tare presented below.  To convert from your compressed sample back to the raw 16-bit \n\t\t\t\tsample, just use your compressed sample as the index into the table, and the corresponding \n\t\t\t\tvalue in the table is your decompressed 16-bit sample.  Obviously, the downside is that \n\t\t\t\tthis method requires the memory overhead for the tables, but each table is only 512 bytes.  \n\t\t\t\tIn this day and age, that's downright cheap for the absolute fastest decompression!\n\t\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\t<br><b>Decompression Code:</b>\n\t\t\t\t<br><font size=\"1\" face=\"Courier, Helvetica, sans-serif\">\n\t\t\t\t<br>static short

Here are some interesting statistics that I found for Oregon:\n<ul>\n\t<li>2017-2019 Dept of Corrections Budget: $1.76B ($880m annually) <a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/doc/ADMIN/docs/pdf/17_19_lab_agency_summary.pdf\">Source</a>\n</li>\n\t<li>Average Daily Prison Population: 14,835 <a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/doc/ADMIN/docs/pdf/17_19_lab_operations.pdf\">Source</a>\n</li>\n\t<li>Average cost per inmate: $59,319 ($880m / 14,835)</li>\n</ul>\nSo who is in our prison system? Here are some other things I found: <a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/doc/RESRCH/docs/inmate_profile.pdf\">Source</a>\n<ul>\n\t<li>White 74.5% (vs 76.4% of normal state population)</li>\n\t<li>Hispanic 12.1% (vs 12.8% of normal state population)</li>\n\t<li>Black 9% (vs 2.1% of normal state population)</li>\n\t<li>62.7% are over the age of 30</li>\n\t<li>Male 81%</li>\n\t<li>Female 19%</li>\n</ul>\nTop 5 incarceration rates by county: <i><a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/doc/RESRCH/docs/admissions_county_20130630.pdf\">Source</a></i>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Sherman County, 2.83 / 1000</li>\n\t<li>Marion County, 2.14 / 1000</li>\n\t<li>Jefferson County, 1.96 / 1000</li>\n\t<li>Linn County, 1.89 / 1000</li>\n\t<li>Clatsop County, 1.86 / 1000</li>\n</ol>\nAnd what did they do to get there? <a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/doc/RESRCH/docs/inmate_profile.pdf\">Source</a>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Drugs 20%</li>\n\t<li>Assault 13.4%</li>\n\t<li>Other 12.6%</li>\n\t<li>Theft 9.3%</li>\n\t<li>Burglary 8.9%</li>\n</ol>\nThis also made me curious relative to education in Oregon. Here are a few statistics I found:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Average Teacher Salary: $59,204 <i><a href=\"http://www.osba.org/-/media/Files/Resources/Employee-Management/Average-Salary-Map-14-15.pdf?la=en\">Source</a></i>\n</li>\n\t<li>Total Number of Teachers: 22,357<i> </i><i><a href=\"https://www.ode.state.or.us/wma/data/schoolanddistrict/students/docs/class_size_report_to_legislature_20142015.pdf\">Source</a></i>\n</li>\n\t<li>Median Class Size: 25 <a href=\"https://www.ode.state.or.us/wma/data/schoolanddistrict/students/docs/class_size_report_to_legislature_20142015.pdf\">Source</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\nSo here are some of my random thoughts after doing this research:\n<ul>\n\t<li>It's fascinating that every incarcerated inmate almost exactly equals a full time teacher. (These costs don't even include local and municipal jail costs.)</li>\n\t<li>African American Oregonians are clearly incarcerated at a much higher rate than either caucasian or hispanic Oregonians.</li>\n\t<li>It's ALARMING that 12.6% of the prison population is incarcerated for offenses labeled as \"other\". Take a look at the source for the incarceration cause breakdown and you can see how granular it gets which makes the \"other\" classification that much more troublesome. (Forgery weighs in at a whopping 0.4%)</li>\n\t<li>The likelihood of incarceration has nothing to do with the population density that you live in. Only one of the top 5 counties in the per capita list would be considered urban.</li>\n</ul>\nDoes any of this mean anything? I'm not sure. I'll definitely be thinking about it for a while. In the alarmist era we currently find ourselves in, I find it helpful to have some actual data behind to fall back on. As such, I've included links to all of my sources in case anyone else feels so inspired to do some data spelunking. If you do, please share what you find!\n\n \n\n \n",

The rules I set for myself were fairly simple:\n<ol>\n\t<li>I must visit a coffee shop each day for 30 days.</li>\n\t<li>I can not have had coffee there previously.</li>\n\t<li>The coffee shop must reside within the boundaries of N/NE Portland. (I did this so that I could somewhat mimic Manton's challenge given the plethora of coffee shops in Portland vs. Austin.)</li>\n\t<li>In order to count as a \"coffee shop\" it must serve lattes (my drink of choice)</li>\n</ol>\nI have now completed my 30 days, and I have to tell you that despite sounding easy, it's actually quite difficult to do ANYTHING for 30 days straight. There were more than a few times that Tiffany had to remind me that I hadn't made my daily trip (especially difficult since most non-chain coffee shops close at 4 p.m.)\n\nAlong the way, I documented each visit on my microblog which <a href=\"https://jonhays.me/category/pdxcoffeehunt/\" target=\"_blank\">you can find here</a>. I also snapped a picture of each location that hopefully gave a small glimpse into the ambiance of each.\n\nThis entire endeavor was an experiment in a number of areas, and I can honestly say that I learned a little bit about myself along the way. As I mentioned, I was microblogging the adventure and somehow ended up having a number of people who followed along. A few have even asked for a summary/recommendation list, to which I am more than happy to oblige.\n\nThe following is my list of coffee shops that I would gladly return to again. The rankings are relative to me, which means that it's based on a blend of coffee quality, ambiance, location and overall comfort (including my ability to work remotely). This is simply a ranked list out of the 30 that I visited, not my overall list for Portland. In fact, I think only one of these would crack my Portland top 10 list.\n\nSo, with all of these caveats out of the way, here is my ordered list of places that I would gladly revisit:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Blend Coffee - I cannot say enough good things about this place. From the cleanliness to the thoughtfulness of the seating to the ridiculous number of power outlets, everything about this place is well thought out. I only wish it was closer to my home. That being said, this is the only coffee shop on my list that I would go out of my way to visit. If you haven't been here, I absolutely recommend a visit.</li>\n\t<li>Bassotto - This place was an absolute gem of a find because it's actually a fantastic coffee shop disguised as a gelateria. It also doesn't hurt that it's located next door to the amazing Tamale Boy, but I think I'd come back even if it was located elsewhere. Finding Bassotto was one of the reasons that I did this challenge. It allowed me to find an awesome place that I normally wouldn't have tried on my own.</li>\n\t<li>Prince Coffee - This place is SMALL. It's also very new and in the beautiful Kenton neighborhood. I will revisit this place if for nothing else than their homemade stroopwafels.</li>\n\t<li>Miss Zumstein - This location is very comfortable, but their pastries are wonderful. The staff is friendly, and they have great coffee, but man are those pastries good.</li>\n\t<li>Locale Coffee - This is another of the new-wave Portland coffee shops located in the Mississippi neighborhood. I would definitely go back to it again, but there's nothing particularly special about it. If you're looking for a decent place to meet someone for coffee and you need to be near Mississippi, you can't really go wrong here.</li>\n\t<li>Saint Simon - This is yet another stereotypical new-wave Portland coffee shop. It has good coffee, is nice inside, has a good location, but is a little too \"trendy\" for my taste. Think I'm exaggerating? Everything from the moose head on the wall to the forced industrial look to the \"wood block\" seating just screams Portlandia. I'd definitely take coffee from here again, but I probably wouldn't stay for long.</li>\n\t<li>Seven Virtues - I didn't want to like Seven Virtues because I find the entire Zipper building to be somewhat pretentious and annoying, but I have to admit that it was pretty nice inside and they had good coffee to boot. I've heard from at least one person that they went here right after it opened and were very unhappy with their experience. Perhaps they had some initial issues getting going?</li>\n\t<li>Posie's Cafe - I'm not sure if I liked Posie's based on its own merits or because it's located in the Kenton neighborhood. Regardless, I found it to be very charming and a nice place to pop into if you're looking for a quick caffeine pick me up. They had a lot of seating and had some pretty good looking pastries as well.</li>\n</ol>\nAnd that is it. Out of 30, I would revisit 8. Of the 8, only one of them would crack my top Portland Coffee Shops list. (I'll try to put that together soon as well.)\n\nAs I mentioned, the challenge was more difficult than I expected given how often I go to coffee. In fact, I've started thinking differently about 30 day challenges in general and I have a few more I might try in the next few months. If you'd like to see the entire list of 30, I've included it below.

However frightening this might sound, a Cease and Desist is not the same as a lawsuit. You are not being sued. You are simply being informed that you need to make a change in accordance with someone else&rsquo;s real or perceived protection of their intellectual property. So, what should you do? Here are a few things that I have learned along the way:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Don&rsquo;t panic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Despite the fact that these messages intentionally sound scary, you don&rsquo;t need to be afraid. In the example above, phrases like &ldquo;infringement&rdquo; and &ldquo;can not tolerate&rdquo; make it sound like these folks mean business and are prepared to bring down the hammer of justice. But if you look more closely, you will see that usually these messages are form letters. Notice that nothing mentions the name of my company or even my name. In fact, there is really nothing of substance in the email.

Just because you receive a C&amp;D, it is still the responsibility of the claimant to show that you are at fault. Yes, you ultimately may be required to make a change but there are several things that need to be established first. Being polite and professional will go a long way in these types of issues. Additionally, do not immediately remove your app for sale or whatever it is they are requesting that you do. Doing so at this point would be acting with incomplete information, which leads to the third point.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ask for additional information<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There are a variety of reasons to do this. The first is to signal that you have received their request and are acting in good faith. This is also to flag the fact that their claim is incomplete.

Here was my response to the C&amp;D above:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hello Ms. [REDACTED],<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Would you please send either a scanned copy of proof of your trademark or send via postal service a hardcopy that clearly shows when the trademark was issued and under what jurisdiction it applies and we will be happy to comply.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sincerely,<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jonathan Hays<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>An excellent action is to ask for actual documentation of the patent, trademark or copyright. A few times, I have asked for documentation only to find that what they sent had absolutely no application to my app or that they were claiming to own something that they did not. If they cannot provide proof then they have no claim. Additionally, if you received the C&amp;D through Apple Legal, make sure to cc them on all of your discourse with the lawyer.

This can be fairly dry reading, but I assure you that it is worth it and that it is no less obtuse than technical documentation on the latest APIs. For example, many patents have multiple claims in them. A great thing to do is to ask for clarification regarding which claims they are actually citing against you. This is especially important if the C&amp;D you received was a form letter because it means that your company was collected in some large data sweep without anyone actually taking the time to look at your App. As with any bulk data collection, there can be errors. At this point, you may or may not want to consult a lawyer on your side, however it is certainly fine to make the people that sent you a C&amp;D actually do their jobs by asking for more information.

Ultimately, I resolved the issue by simply removing it for sale in Canada and the app continues to garner downloads in all of the other App Stores. If I had not asked their lawyer to clarify the claimed jurisdiction, I might have lost out on continued revenue in the other countries for absolutely no reason.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>As developers we generally avoid conflict. All things being equal, we prefer to make things. However, when we make things that we sell commercially, we often have to deal with lawyers and Cease and Desist requests. Always remember that these are requests, not legally binding demands. If/when you receive a C&amp;D, do your due diligence. Be calm. Take measured steps. If all else fails, keep in mind that every time you send a request back to the lawyer on the other side of the C&amp;D you are incurring billable hours to whomever is requesting the Cease and Desist. It's only seems fair that if you're going to lose time and money, that they be willing to do the work to back it up.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

To that end, we are announcing today that we have purchased <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photos+-best-way-to-manage/id770297540?mt=8\">Photos+</a> from <a href=\"http://www.secondgearsoftware.com\">Second Gear Software</a>. We have quite a bit of expertise with photo Apps (see <a href=\"http://sunlit.io\">Sunlit</a>, among others) and when Justin Williams approached me about purchasing it from him, it felt like a great fit. We have big plans for <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photos+-best-way-to-manage/id770297540?mt=8\">Photos+</a> and have already put into motion the first phase of those plans: native Dropbox integration! Photos+ 1.1 is live on the App Store now so go <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photos+-best-way-to-manage/id770297540?mt=8\">check it out</a>. As we roll out the next phases of the Photos+ roadmap, you will be glad that you got in early!\n\nNew company, new software, new hopes and fears. In the end though, I'm pretty excited about what's happening. Stay tuned for more news as the leap towards the net continues!\n",

This is Apple's huge advantage, and as a platform, it is in Apple's best interests to treat the App Store as a meritocracy where the best of the best rise to the top. Right now, that isn't happening. I really hope that someone at Apple is paying attention.\n",

				"content_text": "<p>One of the things that we established early on as a core principle for <a href=\"http://sunlit.io\">Sunlit</a> was that we wanted to make sure we were focused on story telling and the sharing of stories and not on things on the periphery. Many times during development, we were tempted to create an über-camera or a whiz-bang photo editor, however the App Store is full of other apps that do these things and do them well. We do include a fairly simple camera in the app as well as some beautiful filters that can be applied, but what we really envisioned was people using either the built in camera app or a great third party app (such as <a href=\"http://pic.favd.net\">Favd</a>) to take their photos and then create a story with <a href=\"http://sunlit.io\">Sunlit</a> using the pictures they had already taken.</p><p>To us, the true beauty of Sunlit is how it pulls together the value created from other platforms (<a href=\"http://app.net\">App.net</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com\">Dropbox</a>, <a href=\"http://ohaiapp.net\">Ohai</a>, etc.) and creates something that combines all those things into something that is somehow more moving than any of them alone. To that end, it was important that we provide a way for Sunlit to fit into this evolving macro-system because we recognize that the best apps and the best user experiences come when things work cohesively. We are always re-evaluating how we can do this best, but I am very happy that Sunlit launched with 1.0 support for a number of URL schemes, including support for the <a href=\"http://x-callback-url.com\">x-callback specification</a>. We also have a number of actions that can be invoked externally to allow other apps to extend support for Sunlit into the activities that they do well. The URL schemes are <a href=\"https://github.com/manton/sunlit/blob/master/urls.md\">documented here</a> and are updated as we add support for other actions. If you are interested in adding support for any of these and need assistance, feel free to shoot me a message on ADN (@cheesemaker) or post your question in the Sunlit <a href=\"http://glassboard.com\">Glassboard</a> Forum (invite code SUNLIT) or just shoot an email to <a href=\"mailto:support@riverfold.com\">support@riverfold.com</a></p><p>Now go build something great!</p>\n",

I'm sure that somehow this has seeped into my psyche in ways that I don't recognize. Lest you think I exaggerate, I leave the following for your consideration:\n<ul>\n\t<li>1986 - Portland Trailblazers use #2 draft pick to select Sam Bowie, passing over a rookie Michael Jordan</li>\n\t<li>1989 - Gary Payton and OSU appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated as the #1 team in the country. They stay in the top 10 all year, but fall to Ball State in the first round of the NCAA tournament. (BALL STATE! I don't even know where Ball State is!!!)</li>\n\t<li>1990 - Portland Trailblazers lose to the Detroit Pistons in the NBA championship.</li>\n\t<li>1992 - Portland Trailblazers lose to the Chicago Bulls in the championship despite being up by 15 in the fourth quarter with Michael Jordan on the bench. (See <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/623285-50-greatest-comebacks-in-sports-history/page/43\">here</a>)</li>\n\t<li>1994- Seattle Supersonics hold league best regular seaon record with 63-19, but lose in the first round to the Denver Nuggets</li>\n\t<li>1996 - Seattle Supersonics set franchise record with 64 wins and advance to the NBA championship series, only to lose to the Chicago Bulls in six games.</li>\n\t<li>2000 - Portland Trailblazers are up by 15 in the fourth quarter in game 7 of the Western Conference finals but fail to score and give the Los Angeles Lakers the series. The Lakers go on to win the championship in 5 games. (See <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/623285-50-greatest-comebacks-in-sports-history/page/45\">here</a>)</li>\n\t<li>2001 - Seattle Mariners set single season win record with 116 wins, yet fall to the New York Yankees in the American League Championship, 4 games to 1.</li>\n\t<li>2002-2006 - University of Oregon makes five straight bowl games and loses all of them.</li>\n\t<li>2003 - University of Oregon men's basketball team wins the Pac-10 championship and enter the NCAA tournament with a #8 seed, only to lose in the first round to Utah.</li>\n\t<li>2005 - Seattle Seahawks go 13-3 in the regular season, and appear in Super Bowl XL as heavy favorites. They go on to lose 21-10 to the #6 seed, wildcard Pittsburgh Steelers.</li>\n\t<li>2007 - University of Oregon football team is ranked #2 in the nation, but quarterback Dennis Dixon tears his ACL with only 3 games to go ending hopes of a national championship.</li>\n\t<li>2007 - Amazingly, the Portland Trailblazers repeat their gaffe from 1986 and draft Greg Oden instead of Kevin Durant. Oden misses entire first season due to injuries and is eventually waived.</li>\n</ul>\nAlso for your consideration...\n\n<strong>The 10 best athletes to never win a championship in the Pacific Northwest:</strong>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Clyde Drexler (After a hall of fame career in Portland, won a championship only after being traded to the Houston Rockets)</li>\n\t<li>Steve Largent (Played 13 seasons for Seahawks, held almost every record a receiver could hold)</li>\n\t<li>Randy Johnson - (Never won with the Mariners in 10 seasons, but won with the Arizona Diamondbacks after being traded.)</li>\n\t<li>Rasheed Wallace (Won championship in Detroit the year after being traded from Portland)</li>\n\t<li>Gary Payton (12 seasons with the Supersonics, won championship after being traded to the Miami Heat)</li>\n\t<li>Scottie Pippin (Won six championships in Chicago, none in Portland despite making the NBA finals in 2000)</li>\n\t<li>Ray Allen (Five seasons with the Sonics. Won championship with Boston Celtics the following year after being traded.)</li>\n\t<li>Ken Griffey Jr. (13 time all star, #6 all time home runs leader, no championships)</li>\n\t<li>Alex Rodriguez (6 years with the Mariners, #5 all time home runs leader, 14 time all star)</li>\n\t<li>Walter Jones (9 time pro-bowl, NFL 2000s All-Decade Team, considered one of the best lineman of all time)</li>\n</ol>\n<strong>Honorable Mention: </strong>Cortez Kennedy(Seahawks), Shawn Kemp(Sonics), Shaun Alexander(Seahawks), Ichiro Suzuki(Mariners)\n\nSo there you have it.

I&rsquo;ll be happy because Sunlit is for me.</p>\n<p>Sunlit is an app that I&rsquo;ve wanted for years and I&rsquo;m thrilled to finally have on my phone. One of my absolute favorite uses for Sunlit is for capturing memories from smaller events. These are events that while important, don&rsquo;t tend to have the significance of a wedding or Disneyland trip so the photos often never see the light of day. With Sunlit, however, I can now do something meaningful with these photos.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year while Sunlit was in beta, I went to a birthday party for my wife&rsquo;s mother. There were about 15 people present and the celebration went on for around 2 hours. During that time, I snapped close to 60 photos of the party. Some of these photos were blurry, some of them were decent, but a few were quite good. On our drive home, I picked the best ones and created &ldquo;Nana&rsquo;s Birthday&rdquo; story. I then used Sunlit to publish &ldquo;Nana&rsquo;s Birthday&rdquo; and suddenly I had a story captured on a web page that I could share with my wife&rsquo;s family quickly via an email or SMS message.</p>\n<p>This is an important thing to me. Before Sunlit, these photos were just photos. The effort to take them was almost more work than it was worth because they would rarely be seen by me, let alone anyone else. With Sunlit, photos turn into memories. They turn into something beautiful that I can share and that can be appreciated and loved by the people I care about.</p>\n<p>So, if you don&rsquo;t like Sunlit, that&rsquo;s ok.

These are events that while important, don't tend to have the significance of a wedding or Disneyland trip so the photos often never see the light of day. With Sunlit, however, I can now do something meaningful with these photos.\n\nEarlier this year while Sunlit was in beta, I went to a birthday party for my wife's mother. There were about 15 people present and the celebration went on for around 2 hours. During that time, I snapped close to 60 photos of the party. Some of these photos were blurry, some of them were decent, but a few were quite good. On our drive home, I picked the best ones and created \"Nana's Birthday\" story. I then used Sunlit to publish \"Nana's Birthday\" and suddenly I had a story captured on a web page that I could share with my wife's family quickly via an email or SMS message.\n\nThis is an important thing to me. Before Sunlit, these photos were just photos. The effort to take them was almost more work than it was worth because they would rarely be seen by me, let alone anyone else. With Sunlit, photos turn into memories. They turn into something beautiful that I can share and that can be appreciated and loved by the people I care about.\n\nSo, if you don't like Sunlit, that's ok. Sunlit is for me, but Sunlit is also for sharing so I really do hope you like it too.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/8654dc8b57.jpg\"> \n",

				"content_text": "<p>How much memory can an app allocate on an iPad 1? It seems like a trivial question. The original iPad has been in circulation for over 3 years now and developers have written thousands of apps, many of which are memory intensive. Given this, one would expect that this limit has been well documented and should show up easily in search results. As I found out recently, this is not the case.</p><p>A few weeks ago, I needed to revisit memory consumption on an app running on an iPad 1, and I became very curious about the answer to this question. After searching various sites I was mostly coming up empty. To my surprise, it was quite difficult to find this documented anywhere. <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Performance/Conceptual/ManagingMemory/Articles/AboutMemory.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001880-BCICIHAB\">Apple's own documentation</a> is of course great reading for any developer but remains mum on memory budgets. Perhaps the best documentation I could find was <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6044147/memory-limit-and-ios-memory-allocation-in-iphone-sdk\">this Stack Overflow post</a>, but it didn't seem to be definitive and as with all Stack Overflow posts, caveat emptor.</p><p>One thing that I did find sprinkled around the various posts on the topic was a link to <a href=\"https://github.com/Split82/iOSMemoryBudgetTest\">Jan Ilavsky's tool</a> that he wrote to measure on a device the various points when an app receives memory warnings and then ultimately crashes due to insufficient memory. <a href=\"http://jonathanhays.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/memorytoolsnapshot.png\">Here's a shot of it in action</a>. Using Jan's tool, I decided that perhaps I should help contribute to the collective information of the Internet by running some tests and documenting them.</p><p>So as not to boil the ocean, I decided to analyze only the iPad family of devices. My test devices included: a first generation iPad, a second generation iPad, a third generation iPad and an iPad Mini. All of the devices were upgraded to the latest version of iOS that supported them*. My procedure was to force quit all apps on the device before running the test app and then to run the test a minimum of 10 times on each device. I would then throw out the low and the high and graph the results. I found to be both interesting and somewhat predictable:</p>[caption id=\"attachment_58\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://jonathanhays.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ipad1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-58\" alt=\"First Generation iPad\" src=\"http://jonathanhays.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ipad1.jpg?w=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"179\"></a> First Generation iPad (iOS 5.1.1)<strong> </strong>[/caption][caption id=\"attachment_59\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://jonathanhays.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ipad2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-59\" alt=\"Second Generation iPad (iOS 6.1.3)\" src=\"http://jonathanhays.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ipad2.jpg?w=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"179\"></a> Second Generation iPad (iOS 6.1.3)[/caption][caption id=\"attachment_93\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://jonathanhays.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ipad31.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-93\" alt=\"iPad 3\" src=\"http://jonathanhays.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ipad31.jpg?w=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"179\"></a> iPad 3 (iOS 6.1.3)<strong> </strong>[/caption][caption id=\"attachment_61\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://jonathanhays.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ipadmini.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-61\" alt=\"iPad Mini (iOS 6.1.3)\" src=\"http://jonathanhays.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ipadmini.jpg?w=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"179\"></a> iPad Mini (iOS 6.1.3)[/caption]<p style=\"text-align:left;\">One of the more interesting things that jumped out at me is the fact that Apple seems to take memory optimization seriously, and that their approach appears to not be a one size fits all method for the different devices. Notice how on the second generation iPad and the iPad Mini the OS continues to optimize in order to allow the app more room in which to operate.  Contrast that with the first and third generation iPads which appears to have a flat, non optimizing algorithm.  If indeed memory optimization does have a certain amount of device specificity to it, it would appear that Apple put less time into optimizing these iPads.</p><p style=\"text-align:left;\">This of course makes sense as the first iPad was a previously non-existant category, and the third generation was the first iPad with retina display. You have to imagine that it was a pretty massive undertaking to introduce the retina concept on an OS, toolchain and device level. I don't think any engineer alive would be surprised if the schedule became tight on these projects. The point here however, is that Apple does indeed pay attention to the details and that permeates all the way down to device specific memory optimizations. Developers should of course never become reliant on the presence of these optimizing algorithms but the fact that Apple puts that much attention into it is impressive.</p><p style=\"text-align:left;\">So, back to my original question of how much memory you can allocate on an iPad 1.  Drumroll please. Based on my results, I would say that for the iPad family of devices the following are the maximum allocations that can be performed by an app:</p><h4 style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<strong>First Generation iPad:</strong> 160 MB</h4><h4 style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<strong>Second Generation iPad:</strong> 250 MB**</h4><h4 style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<strong>Third Generation iPad:</strong> 515 MB</h4><h4 style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<strong>iPad Mini</strong>: 275 MB***</h4><p style=\"text-align:left;\"><br>Now, I wouldn't be doing my civic duty if I didn't point out that these numbers include things that are entirely out of your control such as core graphics objects.  The test application is the most plain vanilla of apps so the minute you start making anything interesting this number will begin to be impacted. In the end, there is simply no replacement for good old fashioned testing and optimizing so keep that in mind as you're setting out to make the next Angry Birds. I do find this helpful however because it is useful to know and be aware of what my overall ceiling is so that I can spend time optimizing the things that need optimizing and spend the rest of the time building features.</p><h6 style=\"text-align:left;\">* iOS 5.1.1 on the iPad 1 and iOS 6.3.1 on the other devices</h6><h6 style=\"text-align:left;\">** The 2nd gen iPad appears to be able to go as high as 295MB</h6><h6 style=\"text-align:left;\">*** The iPad Mini appears to be able to go as high as 315 MB</h6>\n",

Like many people I have followed a pattern of ups and downs in terms of blogging continuity throughout my online existence, and it is my sincere intent to break the cycle this time around.  In particuar, <a href=\"http://www.manton.org/2013/04/more_blogging_week.html\">Manton's post</a> combined with <a href=\"http://mattgemmell.com/2013/07/12/not-a-geek/\">Matt Gemmell's article</a> have rekindled a desire to be better about developing and sustaining a rhythm.  I certainly have plenty of ideas, and it really is only my own lack of discipline that gets in the way. Anyway, I won't blather here longer about new beginnings but if you don't see regular output here, feel free to remind me of what I'm saying here.\n",
